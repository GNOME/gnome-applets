	* Makefile.am: install in Utilities, not Multimedia

	* quicklaunch.c: ignore first button click and translate it to second
	  button click on the handlebox handle so it acts consistent with all
	  the other applets using handleboxes for inside panel moving.  Also
	  follow panel sizes.

	* quicklaunch.c: initial import to the CVS
