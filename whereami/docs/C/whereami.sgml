  <para>
    You don't need to do anything special to use this applet. It will
    report the position of your cursor as you move your mouse about.
  </para>
  <para>
    This applet is very useful if you wish to set up programs to start
    in particular areas of your screen. For that, you need to tell those
    programs the <option>--geometry</option> option to use. The numbers
    it uses are precisely those which this applet reports.
  </para>
  <para>
    The following options are available.

      If you press <mousebutton>mouse button 1</mousebutton> over the 
      applet, your cursor will change. If you then move it to somewhere 
      on your screen and press <mousebutton>button 1</mousebutton>again 
      and hold it down whilst moving the mouse about, the applet will 
      report the relative position of the cursor from that point, rather 
      than the overall position.
