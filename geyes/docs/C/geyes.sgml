   <title>The gEyes applet</title>
   <para>
     The GNOME panel <application>gEyes</application> is an applet
     which adorns your panel with a pair of eyes which follow your
     mouse pointer around the screen. It is part of the gnome-applets 
     package. This section of the guide refers to gEyes-1.1.2, which 
     is distributed in gnome-applets-1.1.2.
   </para>
   <para>
     To add the gEyes to your <interface>panel</interface>, you can
     press <mousebutton>mouse button 2</mousebutton> on an empty
     part of the <interface>panel</interface> and follow the sequence
    <menuchoice>
     <guimenu>Applets</guimenu>
     <guisubmenu>Amusements</guisubmenu>

       Once it is present, you don't need to do anything to gEyes.
       If you want to, though, the following options are available:

       The <interface>properties dialogue box</interface> (which calls
       itself &quot;gEyes Settings&quot; rather than properties) lets you select
       a theme for the eyes. The themes vary from the (relatively)
       sensible to the bizarre.

         With the honourable exception of Default-tiny, most of the themes 
         will be too large for some sizes of panels and force the panel
         to resized.
