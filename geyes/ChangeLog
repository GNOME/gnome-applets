2004-06-09  Dennis Smit  <ds@nerds-incorporated.org>

	* themes.c (properties_cb): Put the treeview
	in a scrolled window and make the dialog a tad
	bigger so everything fits better in it.

	* docs/ja/*: Put back ja docs since the original
	author never got back to me.

2004-03-16  Glynn Foster  <glynn.foster@sun.com>

	* docs/Makefile.am: Add l10n'd docs to the build.

2004-03-15  Glynn Foster  <glynn.foster@sun.com>

	Removed bogus return.

2004-02-26  Dennis Smit  <ds@nerds-incorporated.org>

	* geyes.h: Bumping up MAX_EYES hard limit
	to 1000. 100 eyes seem to fit with a high
	resolution.

2004-02-26  Dennis Smit  <ds@nerds-incorporated.org>

	* geyes.c (applet_back_change):
	Cleaned up and fixed transparency for color
	background panels.

	(applet_set_back_pixmap):

	Set the right screen when the user requests
	the about dialog and it's already there

2004-02-23  Dennis Smit  <ds@nerds-incorporated.org>

	* geyes.c (destroy_cb): Destroy the eye
	box and GtkWidget eye array.

	(destroy_eyes):
	Free the GtkWidget eye array.

	(setup_eyes):
	Allocate memory for the eye array.

	* geyes.h: Changed GtkWidget *eyes[MAX_EYES] into
	GtkWidget **eyes within the EyesApplet structure.

	Bumped MAX_EYES up to 100 which is basicly sanity
	because themes with such a great number of eyes are
	insane anyway.

	* themes.c (parse_theme_file):
	Check if the eyes in the theme is above MAX_EYES. If
	so set the num_eyes entry to MAX_EYES.

	Fixes bug #106315.

2004-02-22  Dennis Smit  <ds@nerds-incorporated.org>

	* themes.c (theme_dirs_create):

	installed in ~/.gnome2/geyes-themes/ works again.

	* geyes.c (geyes_applet_factory):
	Call theme_dirs_create.

	* geyes.c (properties_load): Check if the theme didn't have a fatal.
	(create_eyes): Remove properties_load and setup_eyes here and do that
	after the signals have been connected so we can fire the destroy
	signal from properties_load, this happens when there is a major
	error while loading the theme file.
	(geyes_applet_fill):
	Do the properties_load and setup_eyes after the signals are bind. Also
	check on error from properties_load.
	(geyes_applet_factory):
	Check on error, and exit if one happened.
	* geyes.h: Changed prototype for load_theme to reflect changes in

	* src/geyes.c: Added the basics of a theming system.  This
	affected 90% of the code, and added a lot more.  Lots of change, too

1999-04-01  Dave Camp  <dave@davec.dhs.org>

	color depth (an assertion fails) even though it was perfectly valid
