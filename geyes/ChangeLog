	Removed bogus return.

2004-02-26  Dennis Smit  <ds@nerds-incorporated.org>

	* geyes.h: Bumping up MAX_EYES hard limit
	to 1000. 100 eyes seem to fit with a high
	resolution.

2004-02-26  Dennis Smit  <ds@nerds-incorporated.org>

	Bumped MAX_EYES up to 100 which is basicly sanity
	because themes with such a great number of eyes are
	insane anyway.

	* themes.c (parse_theme_file):
	Check if the eyes in the theme is above MAX_EYES. If
	so set the num_eyes entry to MAX_EYES.

	* geyes.c (properties_load): Check if the theme didn't have a fatal.
	(create_eyes): Remove properties_load and setup_eyes here and do that
	after the signals have been connected so we can fire the destroy
	signal from properties_load, this happens when there is a major
	error while loading the theme file.
	(geyes_applet_fill):
	Do the properties_load and setup_eyes after the signals are bind. Also
	check on error from properties_load.

	loading the theme.

	* src/geyes.c (destroy_eyes): Created this to destroy the eyes before
	creating a new set.

	* src/themes.c (load_theme): Now takes the theme directory instead of
	the theme name.
	(destroy_theme): Created this function to deallocate resources 
	allocated when loading the theme.
	(load_theme): Took deallocation out of this function.

	* src/geyes.c (create_eyes): Split out creating eyes from creating

	* src/themes.c (properties_cb): Created a themes dialog.
	(apply_cb): And it's "apply" callback.

1999-04-19  Dave Camp  <dave@davec.dhs.org>
	* autogen.sh: Still had "Dryad" from the project I stole the framework
	from.  Changed that.

1999-04-19  Dave Camp  <dave@davec.dhs.org>

1999-04-19  Dave Camp  <dave@davec.dhs.org>

	* src/geyes.c (parse_theme_file): Added the "number of eyes" to the 
	theming system.

	(create_eyes_applet): ...and here.

1999-04-19  Dave Camp  <dave@davec.dhs.org>

	* src/geyes.c: Added the basics of a theming system.  This
	affected 90% of the code, and added a lot more.  Lots of change, too
	much to really list here.  I'll be better with the changelog now that
	the huge restructuring is done.

1999-04-01  Dave Camp  <dave@davec.dhs.org>

	* src/geyes.c (draw_eye): Took out some #if'ed out code 

1999-04-01  Dave Camp  <dave@davec.dhs.org>

	* configure.in: Bumped version.

1999-04-01  Dave Camp  <dave@davec.dhs.org>

	* src/geyes.c (create_eyes_applet): GTK+ 1.2.1 doesn't like -1 as a 
	color depth (an assertion fails) even though it was perfectly valid
	in 1.2.0, and there is code to deal with it.  gEyes now calculates the
	colordepth itself.

1999-04-01  Dave Camp  <dave@davec.dhs.org>

	* src/geyes.c (draw_eyes): Moved pixmap creation to create_eyes_applet.
	(create_eyes_applet): Moved pixmap creation here No only created once,
	as opposed to every few milliseconds :).

1999-04-01  Dave Camp  <dave@davec.dhs.org>

	* src/geyes.c : Fixed the formatting.  What happened to it? 

1999-03-13  Dave Camp  <dave@davec.dhs.org>

	* configure.in: Took out the "macros/Makefile" line.

	* src/geyes.c (create_eyes_applet): Oops - forgot a "g".  The applet
	now restarts with the panel

1999-03-12  Dave Camp  <dave@davec.dhs.org>

	* src/geyes.c : Initial check-in (so to speak)
