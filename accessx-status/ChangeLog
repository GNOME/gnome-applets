	* applet.c: Merge Bill Haneman's fix for bug
	#126201 from HEAD. We should be good to go for a new release now :-)

	* applet.c (timer_reset_slowkeys_image) : gtk_image_set_from_pixbuf
	adds a ref, it does not assume it.  We need to unref to avoid a leak.
	(timer_reset_bouncekeys_image) : ditto.
	(accessx_status_applet_update) : put down the crack pipe, step away
	from the keyboard and _RTFM_.  The image takes care of it's own ref
	counting we don't need to free that, what we do need to free are the
	newly created images from the accessx_status_applet_*_image routines
	that gtk_image_set_from_pixbuf has just added a reference to.

	* applet.c: Get the icon right in the about dialog

2003-05-28  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* Makefile.am, pixmaps/Makefile.am: get the pixmapdirs correct
	
	* applet.c: search for pixmaps in the correct directory. Pass the GtkStyle of the box
	widget otherwise gtk_icon_set_render_icon won't work properly. Don't destroy the sapplet->box
	after removing it from teh container since it is unrefed when removed. 
	
	* .server.in.in: get the icon from the proper directory
