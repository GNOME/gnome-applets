	* applet.c: Fix a typo in the accessible description.
	Fixes bug #128955.
 
2003-12-11  Bill Haneman <bill.haneman@sun.com>  

	* accessx-status/applet.c:
	(accessx_status_applet_init_modifiers): Reinstated the AltGr
	support in case it's fixed on some platforms (harmless but may
	not reflect latched state on some X versions, due to an XKB bug).
	(accessx_status_applet_slowkeys_image): 
	Do our composition into a copy of the 'icon base' image,
	so that we don't write all over the shallow copy returned by
	gtk_widget_render_icon.
	(accessx_status_applet_bouncekeys_image):
	Do compositing into a copy image.  Make sure we return the
	correct, composited image.
	Also adjust the dimensions of dest_x, dest_width, etc. in
	gdk_pixbuf_composite, while reinstating the negative offsets.
	This keeps us from writing into invalid areas of the dest image.
	Reinstate the double-compositing, so that the bouncekeys image
	contains a localized representation of a 'double strike' key.
	(accessx_status_applet_mousekeys_image):
	Composite into a pixbuf copy so that we don't overwrite the base
	image when compositing in our buttons and dots.
	Removed a couple of obsolete query comments.

	This fixes bug #126201.

	* accessx-status/applet.c: accessx_status_applet_destroy ()
	  Removed the filter using gdk_window_remove_filter().

	  Fix the bug#125294

	* applet.c : gdk_pixbuf_composite fixing.
	1) The dest_{width, height} correspond to the amount of src you want
	   to draw onto the dest.
	2) a negative offset moves you outside the source pixbuf.  Not sure
	   what you were trying to do here.
	3) PangoLayouts are GObjects you can just unref them
	(dialog_cb) : PanelApplet is not a GtkWindow.

	* applet.c (timer_reset_slowkeys_image) : gtk_image_set_from_pixbuf
	  adds a ref, it does not assume it.  We need to unref to avoid a leak.
	(timer_reset_bouncekeys_image) : ditto.
	(accessx_status_applet_update) : put down the crack pipe, step away
	  from the keyboard and _RTFM_.  The image takes care of it's own ref
	  counting we don't need to free that, what we do need to free are the
	  newly created images from the accessx_status_applet_*_image routines
	  that gtk_image_set_from_pixbuf has just added a reference to.
	(create_applet) : gtk_image_new_from_pixbuf _adds_ a reference we
	  still need to unref.

	* applet.c: when started in lockdown mode, hide the access x
	  preference dialog.

	* applet.c: cast properly to get rid of warning

2003-07-26  Kevin Vandersloot

	* Makefile.am: Add X_LIBS to fix build. Patch from Damien Carbery. Fixes
	bug #116702

2003-06-30  Bill Haneman

	* GNOME_AccessxApplet.xml:
	Changed context menu to "Keyboard Accessibility Preferences"

	* GNOME_AccessxStatusApplet.server.in.in:
	Put in "Utility" menu instead of "Accessories".

2003-06-15  Kevin Vandersloot

	* applet.c: Expand the applet for Fitts' law and bind both double click and
	enter/space for the keyboard accessibility pref dialog

2003-06-20  Abel Cheung  <maddog@linux.org.hk>

	* docs/C/accessx-status-C.omf: Fix wrong url.

2003-05-30  Kevin Vandersloot

	* applet.c: Get the icon right in the about dialog

2003-05-28  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* Makefile.am, pixmaps/Makefile.am: get the pixmapdirs correct
	
	* applet.c: search for pixmaps in the correct directory. Pass the GtkStyle of the box
	widget otherwise gtk_icon_set_render_icon won't work properly. Don't destroy the sapplet->box
	after removing it from teh container since it is unrefed when removed. 
	
	* .server.in.in: get the icon from the proper directory
