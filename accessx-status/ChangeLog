	* Makefile.am, pixmaps/Makefile.am: get the pixmapdirs correct
	
	* applet.c: search for pixmaps in the correct directory. Pass the GtkStyle of the box
	widget otherwise gtk_icon_set_render_icon won't work properly. Don't destroy the sapplet->box
	after removing it from teh container since it is unrefed when removed. 
	
	* .server.in.in: get the icon from the proper directory
