2005-02-27  Ryan Lortie  <desrt@desrt.ca>

	* applet.c: Don't leak style while handling the change_background
	signal.  Fix adapted from Vincent Untz's fixes to various panel
	applets.

2005-02-24  Kjartan Maraas  <kmaraas@gnome.org>

	* applet.c: Make some functions and vars static.

2005-02-08  Davyd Madeley  <davyd@madeley.id.au>

	* GNOME_AccessxStatusApplet.server.in.in:
	* pixmaps/Makefile.am: Install copy of application icon in the icon
	  theme.

2005-01-17  Davyd Madeley  <davyd@madeley.id.au>

	* applet.c: Fix applet transparency.

2005-01-13  Davyd Madeley  <davyd@madeley.id.au>

	* applet.c: Fix file location for pixmaps.
	* docs/C/accessx-status-C.omf: Use correct OMF (not one from mixer).
	  Closes 163782. Patch from Matt Keenan <matt.keenan@sun.com>.

2004-10-15  Leena Gunda  <leena.gunda@wipro.com>

	* applet.c: (help_cb): Fix crash when there is error to display 
	help. Fixes bug #147718.

2004-08-24  Davyd Madeley  <davyd@madeley.id.au>

	* applet.c: Fix spelling mistake. s/Extenstion/Extension/
	Closes #150889.

2004-08-15  Kjartan Maraas  <kmaraas@gnome.org>

	* Makefile.am: Remove references to screen-exec.
	* applet.c: (help_cb): Use gnome_help_*

2004-06-18  Arvind Samptur  <arvind.samptur@wipro.com>

	* applet.h: Add AccessxStatusErrorType enum.
	* applet.c: (accessx_status_applet_realize):
	(accessx_status_applet_xkb_select): Set the error flag
	if XKB support is not there.
	(popup_error_dialog): pop up the appropriate error message
	based on the error flag.
	Fixes bug #140281

2004-05-20  Padraig O'Briain <padraig.obriain@sun.com>

	* applet.c:
	(accessx_status_applet_layout_box): Check that sapplet->box is
	realized instead of sapplet->applet and also check that 
	sapplet->initialized is set before calling 
	accessx_status_applet_update.
	(accessx_status_applet_realize): Call accessx_status_applet_reset
	in an idle handler.
	(accessx_status_applet_fill): If sapplet->box was realised call
	accessx_status_applet_initialize instead of connecting to "realize"
	signal. Call accessx_status_applet_reset if sapplet->box was realized
	instead of always calling it in a timeout handler.

	Fixes bug #137585.
	
2004-03-04  Bill Haneman <billh@gnome.org>

	* applet.c:
	(accessx_status_applet_init_modifiers): Don't include
	ISO_Group_Shift and ISO_Group_Latch/Lock in alt_gr_mask;
	if present these probably deserve their own icon (TBD).
	(button_press_callback): Invoke on button-press, not double-click.
	Fix for bug #124018.
	
2004-02-29  Dennis Smit  <ds@nerds-incorporated.org>

	* applet.c (accessx_status_applet_background):
	Removed bogus return.

2004-02-26  Dennis Smit  <ds@nerds-incorporated.org>

	* applet.c (accessx_status_applet_background):
	Added function to listen to panel background
	changes and adopt the applet drawing to the
	panel background.

	(accessx_status_applet_fill): Connect signal
	to change_background.

	This is not working for pixmap backgrounds yet.

2004-02-24  Bill Haneman <billh@gnome.org>

	* applet.c:  Fixes for bug #135292.
	(accessx_status_applet_init_modifiers):
	Detect ISO group/level modifiers as well as
	"old fashioned" XK_Mode_Switch modifier.
	(accessx_status_applet_get_glyph_pixbuf):
	Fixed to work properly with white-on-black.
	(accessx_status_applet_get_icon_set): Fixed to 
	work correctly for SELECTED state (corresponding to 
	LOCKED AltGr modifier).

2004-02-23  Dennis Smit  <ds@nerds-incorporated.org>

	* applet.c (about_cb):
	Set the about dialog to the right screen
	when the user requests the about dialog again
	and it's still there but on the wrong screen.

2004-02-23  Dennis Smit  <ds@nerds-incorporated.org>

	* applet.c:
	Doh, I had autoindented way too much lines
	by excident in my previous commit.

	Sorry!, stupid me.

2004-02-22  Dennis Smit  <ds@nerds-incorporated.org>

	* applet.c (dialog_cb):
	Move from egg_screen_execute_shell to
	gdk_spawn_command_line_on_screen.

	Fixes bug #135158. 

2004-02-21  Dennis Smit  <ds@nerds-incorporated.org>

	* Makefile.am: Added libegg stuff from screen-exec/

	* applet.c (help_cb): Moved to libegg, made help
	and error dialog multihead aware.

	Removed the HAVE_EGG defines because the functions
	that are needed are included in the gnome-applets package.

	(dialog_cb):
	Use egg_screen_execute_shell instead of
	gnome_excute_shell so we're multihead aware.

2004-02-08  Kjartan Maraas  <kmaraas@gnome.org>

	* Makefile.am: Remove duplicate definitions. Closes
	bug #124153.

2004-02-02  Kjartan Maraas  <kmaraas@gnome.org>

	* applet.c: Mark accessible name and description for
	translation. Fixes bug #132579.

2004-01-31  Archana Shah <archana.shah@wipro.com>

	* applet.h: Added a field in the structure AccessxStatusApplet
	for about dialog.
	* applet.c: (accessx_status_applet_fill): Initialized about_dialog
	with NULL.
	(about_cb): Changed to use member field instead of static variable
	for about dialog.
	(accessx_status_applet_destroy): Destroys about dialog when the
	applet is removed.
	Fixes bug# 132290

2003-12-22  Muktha <muktha.narayan@wipro.com>

	* applet.c: Fix a typo in the accessible description.
	Fixes bug #128955.
 
2003-12-11  Bill Haneman <bill.haneman@sun.com>  

	* accessx-status/applet.c:
	(accessx_status_applet_init_modifiers): Reinstated the AltGr
	support in case it's fixed on some platforms (harmless but may
	not reflect latched state on some X versions, due to an XKB bug).
	(accessx_status_applet_slowkeys_image): 
	Do our composition into a copy of the 'icon base' image,
	so that we don't write all over the shallow copy returned by
	gtk_widget_render_icon.
	(accessx_status_applet_bouncekeys_image):
	Do compositing into a copy image.  Make sure we return the
	correct, composited image.
	Also adjust the dimensions of dest_x, dest_width, etc. in
	gdk_pixbuf_composite, while reinstating the negative offsets.
	This keeps us from writing into invalid areas of the dest image.
	Reinstate the double-compositing, so that the bouncekeys image
	contains a localized representation of a 'double strike' key.
	(accessx_status_applet_mousekeys_image):
	Composite into a pixbuf copy so that we don't overwrite the base
	image when compositing in our buttons and dots.
	Removed a couple of obsolete query comments.

	This fixes bug #126201.
	
2003-12-7  Shakti Sen <shakti.sen@wipro.com>

	* accessx-status/applet.c: accessx_status_applet_destroy ()
	  Removed the filter using gdk_window_remove_filter().

	  Fix the bug#125294

2003-10-20  Jody Goldberg <jody@gnome.org>

	* applet.c : gdk_pixbuf_composite fixing.
	1) The dest_{width, height} correspond to the amount of src you want
	   to draw onto the dest.
	2) a negative offset moves you outside the source pixbuf.  Not sure
	   what you were trying to do here.
	3) PangoLayouts are GObjects you can just unref them
	(dialog_cb) : PanelApplet is not a GtkWindow.

2003-10-15  Jody Goldberg <jody@gnome.org>

	* applet.c (timer_reset_slowkeys_image) : gtk_image_set_from_pixbuf
	  adds a ref, it does not assume it.  We need to unref to avoid a leak.
	(timer_reset_bouncekeys_image) : ditto.
	(accessx_status_applet_update) : put down the crack pipe, step away
	  from the keyboard and _RTFM_.  The image takes care of it's own ref
	  counting we don't need to free that, what we do need to free are the
	  newly created images from the accessx_status_applet_*_image routines
	  that gtk_image_set_from_pixbuf has just added a reference to.
	(create_applet) : gtk_image_new_from_pixbuf _adds_ a reference we
	  still need to unref.

Mon Sep 15 15:15:08 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* applet.c: when started in lockdown mode, hide the access x
	  preference dialog.

Mon Sep 15 14:22:30 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* applet.c: cast properly to get rid of warning

2003-07-26  Kevin Vandersloot

	* Makefile.am: Add X_LIBS to fix build. Patch from Damien Carbery. Fixes
	bug #116702

2003-06-30  Bill Haneman

	* GNOME_AccessxApplet.xml:
	Changed context menu to "Keyboard Accessibility Preferences"

	* GNOME_AccessxStatusApplet.server.in.in:
	Put in "Utility" menu instead of "Accessories".

2003-06-15  Kevin Vandersloot

	* applet.c: Expand the applet for Fitts' law and bind both double click and
	enter/space for the keyboard accessibility pref dialog

2003-06-20  Abel Cheung  <maddog@linux.org.hk>

	* docs/C/accessx-status-C.omf: Fix wrong url.

2003-05-30  Kevin Vandersloot

	* applet.c: Get the icon right in the about dialog

2003-05-28  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* Makefile.am, pixmaps/Makefile.am: get the pixmapdirs correct
	
	* applet.c: search for pixmaps in the correct directory. Pass the GtkStyle of the box
	widget otherwise gtk_icon_set_render_icon won't work properly. Don't destroy the sapplet->box
	after removing it from teh container since it is unrefed when removed. 
	
	* .server.in.in: get the icon from the proper directory
