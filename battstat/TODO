Figure out why the l10n doesn't work... Running truss on
battstat_applet shows that it doesn't even try to open the battstat.mo
file.

Some weirdiosity is going on... The configure script is creating a
"battstat_applet-battstat_applet.o" rule. I have no idea where it's
coming from. Although I haven't really looked for it yet. I must be
doing something stupid somewhere?

Make the appearance of the GUI more configurable. Maybe give the user
the choice of customizing the different colors of the progress bar?

Center the preview frame horizontally. Maybe with an alignment widget?

Make sure that I free everything I have allocated.

Find out if I should be doing a gdk_draw_pixmap instead of
gtk_pixmap_set in pixmap_timeout.

Write some code to handle vertical panels.

Split up the code in more functions so that I can reuse code
better. As it is now I'm doing the same thing in at least three
different places throughout the program.

Move the functions into separate .c files.

Move the code to src/.

Find out how to implement the status dock stuff better. For example,
don't allocate space for it until the user explicitly demands it.
