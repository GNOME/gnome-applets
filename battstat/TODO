Figure out why the l10n doesn't work... Running truss on
battstat_applet shows that it doesn't even try to open the battstat.mo
file.

Some weirdiosity is going on... The configure script is creating a
"battstat_applet-battstat_applet.o" rule. I have no idea where it's
coming from. Although I haven't really looked for it yet. I must be
doing something stupid somewhere.

Make the appearance of the GUI more configurable. Maybe give the user
the choice of customizing the different colors of the progress bar?

Center the preview frame horizontally. Maybe with an alignment widget?

Make the APM calls more robust. Find out what the Linux call apm_open
returns if it can't talk to the APM device and so on.

Make sure that I free everything I have allocated.

Find out if I should be doing a gdk_draw_pixmap instead of
gtk_pixmap_set in pixmap_timeout.

Fix a bug that affected one user under Linux. The applet crashed when the
battery was completely drained and the charge was -1. Fixed in 2.0.6?

Write some code to handle vertical panels.
