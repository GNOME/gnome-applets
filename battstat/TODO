Make the appearance of the GUI more configurable. Maybe give the user
the choice of customizing the different colors of the progress bar?

Center the preview frame horizontally. Maybe with an alignment widget?

Make sure that I free everything I have allocated.

Find out if I should be doing a gdk_draw_pixmap instead of
gtk_pixmap_set in pixmap_timeout.

Write some code to handle vertical panels.

Split up the code in more functions so that I can reuse code
better. As it is now I'm doing the same thing in at least three
different places throughout the program.

Find out how to implement the status dock stuff better. For example,
don't allocate space for it until the user explicitly demands it.

Add the ability to make the applet display time left instead of 
percent left if the BIOS supports it.

Add libglade-gnome-dev to the checks of autoconf
