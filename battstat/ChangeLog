1.0:
	Initial version. Uses the GTK toolkit. Only works with FreeBSD for
	now.

1.1:
	Added the flashing pixmap to the power cord image, showing when
	laptop is recharging.  Added ToolTips.

1.2:
	Added Linux support. (Perhaps, it's untested). Uses the libapm
	library under Linux.
	Added the exclamation mark pixmap. Displayed when system power 
	falls under a specified threshold.

1.2.1:	
	Added Gnome support. Application will now be compiled as a panel
	applet as well as a normal GTK application. Now requires at least
	automake 1.4a if you want to remake the Makefile.in.

1.2.2:
	Minor fixes. 

2.0.0:
	Complete change of appearance. Only works as an applet now. Does
	not require automake 1.4a any longer to recreate Makefile.in.
	Complete rewrite of the GUI.  Added a preferences window.  Added a
	custom progress meter.  Added sound events for "battery almost
	empty" and "battery fully re-charged" events.  Still only tested
	under FreeBSD.

2.0.1: 	
	First public release.

2.0.1a:	
	Problem compiling under Linux reported by Matthias Saou. Added 
	some #ifdefs to fix it.

2.0.1b: 
	Should really work under Linux now. (At least it works on my 
	new Linux installation, Debian 2.2)

2.0.2:
	New configurable option. Now you have the choice of having the
	battery charge meter shrink to the right or the left.

2.0.3:
	New configurable options. One can select if the applet should be
	layout in a horizontal or a squarish fashion. You can also select
	what parts of the applet that should be visible.

2.0.4:
	General code de-uglyfication. Good news, everyone. Two bugs found
	and fixed.  
	I was using 0 and 1 instead of false and true respectivly for some
	options in the session management stuff. That worked fine on the
	version of GNOME I have installed. But it will lead to a
	segmentation fault when using older versions.  
	The second bug caused the applet to crash if one removed the
	battery while running the laptop on AC power.

2.0.5:
	New feature. You can now right click on the applet and suspend
	your laptop by selecting "Suspend the laptop" from the menu. You
	can configure what should happen then in the properties dialog.
	The FreeBSD port Makefile has been cleaned up by Jim Mock.

2.0.6:
	2000-08-18 
	The applet can now use the status dock (if available) to display
	battery status. This part of the applet is not entierly finished
	yet. Suggestions welcome.
	Found a bug in the code where the APM BIOS potentially could
	report 255 instead of 0-2 under Linux. This would result in a seg
	fault.
