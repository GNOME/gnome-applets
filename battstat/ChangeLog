2001-12-26  Pablo Saratxaga  <pablo@mandrakesoft.com>

	* configure.in: Added "az" to ALL_LINGUAS

2001-12-13  Stanislav Visnovsky  <visnovsky@nenya.ms.mff.cuni.cz>

	* configure.in: Added "sk" to ALL_LINGUAS

2001-12-10  Christian Rose  <menthos@menthos.com>

	* configure.in: Added "da", "es", "no", "pt", and "ru" to
	ALL_LINGUAS.

1.0:
	Initial version. Uses the GTK toolkit. Only works with FreeBSD for
	now.

1.1:
	Added the flashing pixmap to the power cord image, showing when
	laptop is recharging.  Added ToolTips.

1.2:
	Added Linux support. (Perhaps, it's untested). Uses the libapm
	library under Linux.
	Added the exclamation mark pixmap. Displayed when system power 
	falls under a specified threshold.

1.2.1:	
	Added Gnome support. Application will now be compiled as a panel
	applet as well as a normal GTK application. Now requires at least
	automake 1.4a if you want to remake the Makefile.in.

1.2.2:
	Minor fixes. 

2.0.0:
	Complete change of appearance. Only works as an applet now. Does
	not require automake 1.4a any longer to recreate Makefile.in.
	Complete rewrite of the GUI.  Added a preferences window.  Added a
	custom progress meter.  Added sound events for "battery almost
	empty" and "battery fully re-charged" events.  Still only tested
	under FreeBSD.

2.0.1: 	
	First public release.

2.0.1a:	
	Problem compiling under Linux reported by Matthias Saou. Added 
	some #ifdefs to fix it.

2.0.1b: 
	Should really work under Linux now. (At least it works on my 
	new Linux installation, Debian 2.2)

2.0.2:
	New configurable option. Now you have the choice of having the
	battery charge meter shrink to the right or the left.

2.0.3:
	New configurable options. One can select if the applet should be
	layout in a horizontal or a squarish fashion. You can also select
	what parts of the applet that should be visible.

2.0.4:
	General code de-uglyfication. Good news, everyone. Two bugs found
	and fixed.  
	I was using 0 and 1 instead of false and true respectivly for some
	options in the session management stuff. That worked fine on the
	version of GNOME I have installed. But it will lead to a
	segmentation fault when using older versions.  
	The second bug caused the applet to crash if one removed the
	battery while running the laptop on AC power.

2.0.5:
	New feature. You can now right click on the applet and suspend
	your laptop by selecting "Suspend the laptop" from the menu. You
	can configure what should happen then in the properties dialog.
	The FreeBSD port Makefile has been cleaned up by Jim Mock.

2.0.6:
	2000-08-18 
	The applet can now use the status dock (if available) to display
	battery status. This part of the applet is not entierly finished
	yet. Suggestions welcome.
	Found a bug in the code where the APM BIOS potentially could
	report 255 instead of 0-2 under Linux. This would result in a seg
	fault.
	Polish translation by Cezary Jackiewicz	<cjackiewicz@poczta.onet.pl>.
	
2.0.7:
	2000-08-21
	Found and fixed a bug where the applet would crash if you put the 
	laptop back on AC power after it's been low on power.

2.0.8:
        2000-10-20 
	The applet has been ported to OpenBSD by Joe Ammond
	<jra@twinight.org>. 

2.0.9:
	2001-02-07
	Rewrote the applet to open the APM device, get the power status
	and then close the device immediately. Previously I kept the
	device opened for as long as the applet was running.
	2001-02-13
	Thomas Hood pointed out that under Linux there's no need to open
	the APM device at all. apm_read() will take care of that by
	reading from /proc and not directly from the device.

2.0.10:
	2001-03-26
	Added a patch from Mikael Hallendal <micke@codefactory.se>. 
	Instead of displaying an error dialog, the applet now 
	displays a warning dialog when the battery is low and an 
	"ok" dialog when the battery is fully re-charged.
	2001-03-27
	Fixed the bug that prevented sounds to be played at battery
	low and battery fully re-charged. I was giving the wrong number of 
	parameters to gnome_triggers_do(). (Assign the sounds in the 
	GNOME Control Center->Multimedia->Sounds)
	Fixed a bug in the Preferences dialog. It will now properly display
	your current "drain" settings (towards bottom, or towards the top) 
	in the "Preview".
	2001-03-29
	Added a logo for the About dialog. (It's a picture of Tesla from
	1899, somewhat modified)
	2001-03-30
	Removed some unneccessary code in pixmap_timeout().
	Removed a unneccessary load_preferences() in init_applet().

2.0.11:
	2001-04-02
	- Added a tooltip for the status dock icon.
	- Changed the algorithm somewhat for when to decide when the battery 
	is fully re-charged. Previously the applet could decide that the
	battery was fully re-charged even when running on battery power 
	at say 10%. Now the laptop needs to be running on AC and it must have
	been "Charging" the previous iteration through the algorithm.
	- Moved the source code to src/ and made the appropriate changes in the
	Makefiles.
	2001-04-03
	- Added the spec file to the CVS so people can build RPMs.
	2001-04-04
	- Split the code into smaller files.
	2001-04-13
	- Started to change the code so it will honor the hints it gets from
	the panel (size and orientation).
	2001-04-14
	- Finished the code change for panel hints.
	- Removed the "Orientation" frame in the Preferences dialog.
	2001-04-17
	- Added an gtk_emit_signal_by_name() to main() so the applet will
	have the correct size at startup. Seems to work now.
	2001-04-21
	- Christian Rose <menthos@menthos.com> added po file to Gnome CVS.
	2001-04-22
	- Chinese translation by Abel Cheung <maddog@linuxhall.org>.
	2001-04-23
	- German translation by Christian Meyer <chrisime@gnome.org>.
	2001-04-24
	- Changed code to use as complete sentences as possible to make
	translation easier.
	- Fixed a bug that has been around for a long time. The tooltip
	over the status frame wouldn't update correctly.
	2001-05-06
	- Added some patches to the RPM spec file, Makefile.am and 
	applet-docs.make from Michael Reinsch <mr@uue.org>. 
	2001-05-28
	- Added code to configure.in to require at least 0.10.37 of gettext.
	- Hungarian translation by Emese Kovacs <emese@gnome.hu>.
        2001-07-19
        - Added build instructions for building Battstat from CVS sources. 

2.0.12:
	2001-08-24
	- Applied patch from Mikael Hallendal <micke@codefactory.se>. Now
	the Properties dialog is created with Glade.
	2001-09-10
	- Applied patch from Travis Saling <trav@u.washington.edu>. This
	fixes a bug where the applet would draw the battery pixmap even
	though you'd told the applet to hide it.
	2001-10-19
	- Changed variable names to more sane ones.
	- Changed some if-conditions.
	2001-10-26
	- Applied patch from Thomas Hood <jdthood@mail.com>. Much needed
	cleanup of certain areas of the code.
	- Added a test for the Battery full notification to see if there
	actually is a battery present in the laptop. Otherwise if the
	laptop was recharging the battery and you would remove it, the
	applet would claim that the battery was fully recharged even
	though there wasn't any battery in the laptop at all.
	- Release of 2.0.12
	
2.0.13:
	2001-10-26
	- Discovered some bugs in the spec file for building RPM's.  One
	totally deranged bug where rpm -bb bs.spec would pack every pixmap
	under /usr/share/pixmap in the .rpm. The other was that the 
	directory for libglade under /usr/share/battstat_applet/ wasn't
	created at all.
	- Fixed a spelling error in src/Makefile.am. Instead of EXTRA_DIST
	it said EXTRADIST. That meant that the libglade file wasn't included
	in the distribution when doing a "make dist". 

2001-12-10 Jörgen Pehrson <jpehrson@cvs.gnome.org>
	To celebrate the fact that Battstat moved into the GNOME CVS the
	format of this changelog has changed. A lot of changes (by others)
	took place between the previous entry in the ChangeLog and this
	entry. For example, ACPI support for Linux was added by Lennart
	Poettering <lennart@poettering.de>, PPC support was added by
	Bastien Nocera <hadess@hadess.net> and a new icon created by Jakub
	"Jimmac" Steiner, <jimmac@linux.com.nospam> was added.  The reason
	for the lack of updated to this file was that I didn't have any
	access to the CVS for a month.

	* configure.in: Added "gnome-config --cflags libglade" so that the
	  build will find the new location for libglade headers.
	* src/Makefile.am Added $(gladeincludedir) to the INCLUDES.
	* MAINTAINERS: Initial version.
