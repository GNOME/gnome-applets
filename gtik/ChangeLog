	* gtik.c: (parseQuote), (Repaint), (remFromClist), (properties_cb),
	(main), (reSetOutputArray), (setOutputArray): more strings are
	dynamicly allocated (less segfaults); fixed bug when removing
	multiple symbols at once

2001-09-13  Jim Garrison  <garrison@users.sourceforge.net>

	* gtik.c: (font_selector), (QuitFontDialog): font selector can
	now be re-opened (fixed patch from kmaraas)

2001-09-13  Jim Garrison  <garrison@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Makefile.am: using gnome-vfs instead of ghttp
	* gtik.c: (xfer_callback), (updateOutput), (properties_load),
	(apply_cb), (font_selector), (main): uses gnome-vfs for async
	ops; applied patch from kjartan to only allow one fonts box
	open at a time; fixed bug which made update interval useless

2001-09-10  Maciej Stachowiak  <mjs@noisehavoc.org>

	* Makefile.am: handle gnome-vfs LIBS and CFLAGS properly.

New Items or fixes in the 0.01b3 Release:

   seg faults when removing from the panel

2. Fixed seg fault when saving properties settings when ran for the
   first time or when the user's gnome properties directory does
   not contain an entry for the ticker symbols.

3. (last but no way least) Jim Garrison got busy and has totally redone
   the make environment and is currently attacking some bugs and features.
   Thanks to Jim, it now Builds without the Gnome Core source tree, as I had 
   been doing. 

    To build:

	Unpack the tar.gz file
	Change Directory to the place you unpacked to
	run:   ./configure  
		or if your gnome stuff is installed under /usr as is on Slackware
			run ./configure --prefix=/usr
	
	run:  make

	Then as Root run:   make install

	NOTE:
		This method of installing will try to copy the gtik_applet.gnorba file to 
		/usr/etc/CORBA/servers/gtik_applet.gnorba . This is where the rest of the
		gnorba files  are on Slackware by default. (Jim and I both work on Slackware)
		However when trying this on Red Hat I found that the gnorba files need to
		go in /etc/CORBA/servers/. 
 		  If you are unable to add the applet from the applet menu, copy the file
		gtik_applet.gnorba to /etc/CORBA/servers/ or where ever the rest of the
		gnorba files are on your distribution. 
		
		Sorry for the inconvenience. We will work this out.




New Items in the 0.01b2 Release:
---------------------------------
Well, it's new. Added a stock ticker


Known Bugs / Missing features
---------------------------------

1. Maybe size option in the properties for the applet.

   From here , I am going to be cleaning up a lot and adding a ton of
features. Please check back ofter, if interested. I am working on a Palm Pilot
link for a future release as well. 




TAR BALLS

gtik_001b3_src.tar.gz		source , builds anyplace. 

gtik_001b2_s7_bin.tar.gz		Binary built on Slackware 7. 
				(also ran on Current Debian rel) 

gtik_001b2_src.tar.gz		source , requires complete gnome
				core tree to build, until I learn
				to do this differently.
