Gnome Stock Ticker (gtik) Release Notes

  Gnome Stock Ticker is a Scrolling Stock ticker Applet for the Gnome Panel.
This uses the GHTTP lib to request a page from Yahooo finance for the stock
symbols you enter into the properties dialog. It saves the file to your
$HOME dir and then parses the HTML to get the data it will scroll. The
Function that actually grabs the page was copied out of the old Slash Applet.
  The update frequency and symbols to display data for are configurable
via a handy properties dialog.

The GHTTP libraries are required to run this.

Please send any bugs, patches, or comments to gtik@dread.net
