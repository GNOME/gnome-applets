TODO:

* better filename completion via [tab]

* use history for command completion, too

* working command completion when using a prefix

* use a real shell (like bash) optionally as backend

* Using gnome-libs call instead of starting gnome-brower via exec?
  [suggested by Kevin M Fox <kmfox@mail.bhi-erc.com>]

* using prefixes from control-center [suggested by Kevin M Fox
  <kmfox@mail.bhi-erc.com>]

* autodetection of non-X programs

	* Using ldd to do this? [suggested by Al Wold
          <alwold@inter-web.net>]

* The ability to paste into it like an xterm would be nice. [suggested
  by Brian J. Murrell <brian@interlinx.bc.ca>]

* make "/bin/sh" changeable [is this really needed?]

* support of speech recognition ;-)



DONE:

* storing history

* Searchable command history, or a key/button to bring up a window
  with a "clickable" command history, or a pulldown or something like
  that.  [suggested by Brian J. Murrell <brian@interlinx.bc.ca>]

* storing preferences

* filename completion via tab

* preferences dialog

	* enable/disable clock

	* configure (one or more) web browsers

* history

* enable launching of non-X programs

* don't store dupes in history
