>Release 1.0.0pre:
	
	* This is v1.0.0 because all basic features have been
	  implemented.

	* Allow pasting into the input box with the middle mouse
	  button (idea taken from the applet WebControl by Garrett
	  Smith).

	* Prefix matching has been improved.

	* Three very useful macros from Chad Powell have been added.
	  I had to increase the maximum allowed macro length just for
	  his macros ;-). You need to remove ~/.gnome/mini-commander
	  to get this new default macro.  Here is Chad's own
	  description:

		The following macro for the Mini-Commander allows you
		to enter av:searchstring and search on altavista.  It
		automatically changes ", +, and spaces to the right
		characters for the url.  I thought you might want to
		add this to the default macros.  I got the idea from
		the new web-search applet, thought that rather than
		have a seperate applet, it would be pretty easy to
		make Mini-Commander do it.

	  He also wrote macros for yahoo and freshmeat which have been
	  included as default macros.

	* Signal handler installation routine has been rerwritten.
	  Hopefully this will fix the "zombie" problem which a few
	  people (Charles Duffy and Brian J. Murrell) have reported.


	* A patch from Nick Lamb has been added which makes the handle
	  box optional.  He writes:

		I saw in your TODO, that you wanted to make the
		Handle-box widget optional, and since people not a
		million miles from me in this lab kept moaning about
		it, I had an itch to scratch :)




Release 0.0.14:

	* Mini-Commander can be detached from panel. This is useful
          for people who use vertical panel.

	* Up to 99 changeable macros are supported.

	* File browser added.

	* Clickable history list added. [suggested by Brian J. Murrell]

	* Dupes are no longer stored in command history.

	* History is stored when the program is terminated and
	  restored when it is started later.

	* Command completion has been enhanced.  Now it works even
	  if a prefix is used.  Also it delivers the largest possible
	  completion even if the given command is not unique.

	* Preferences bug fixed.



Release 0.0.13:

	* Documentation in SGML/DocBook format created.



Release 0.0.12:

	* works with newest gnome libraries (from cvs) again

	  Fox who suggested this on gnome's mailing list)



Release 0.0.11:

	* first support of command completion (use the [tab] key)



Release 0.0.10:

	* configurable height of command line

	* default macros enhanced (for example Kevin M Fox suggested
	  to use gnome-terminal instead of nxterm as default) (you
	  have to do `rm ~/.gnome/mini-commander` to get the new
	  default values)

	* cleaner UI

	* code cleanup



Release 0.0.9:

	* preferences-save-bug fixed

	* support for internationalization (I added a german
	  translation)

	* history remembers current command even if you type KeyUp,
	  KeyDown (suggested by Itamar S.-T.)



Release 0.0.6b:

	* dependency-bug fixed (program didn't compile if gnome wasn't
	  installed in /opt/gnome) (reported by Kevin M Fox and Itamar
	  S.-T.)



Release 0.0.6:

	* wrong-binary-filename-bug fixed

	* properties dialog box added (session management); clock is
	  now optional



Release 0.0.5:

	* autoconf/automake are used for building



Release 0.0.4:

	* new outfit

	* no more zombie processes (thanks to Jacob C. Berkman)



Release 0.0.3:

	* Applet renamed to "Mini-Commander".

	* If you enter a URL then netscape will be started (suggested
	  by Kevin M Fox).

	    
	* If you enter "term:&#60;command&#62;command&#60;/command&#62;" then
	  &#60;command&#62;command&#60;/command&#62; is executed in nxterm or xterm
	  (for non-X programs).

	* Clock added.

	* Fixed a redraw bug of the frame.



Release 0.0.2:

	* Mini-Commander has a history of the last 50 commands.</PRE
