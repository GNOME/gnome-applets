    <title>Introduction</title>
    
    <sect1 id="intro">
      <title>What is
      &mini-c;?</title>
      
      <para>This GNOME applet adds a command line to the panel. It
      features command completion, command history, changeable macros
      and an optional built-in clock.</para>

      <para>Because of the changeable macros you can use &mini-c; for
      many different tasks. You can simply start a program (or a short
      macro) or view a web page or search for a man/info page
      etc.</para>

      <para>&mini-c; has a handler on the left side which allows you
      to detach the applet from the panel.  This feature is especially
      usefull for people who use vertical panels.</para>
    </sect1>

    <sect1 id="screenshots">
      <title>Screenshots</title>
      
      <para>Currently there is just one outdated screenshot. It shows
      &mini-c; and some of its dialog boxes.</para>

      </screenshot>

    </sect1>

    <sect1 id="download">
      <title>Where can I download it?</title>

      <para>Since release 0.0.12 &mini-c; is part of gnome-core.  So
      if you are happy with it as it is there is no need for you to
      download and compile separate sources.  Only if you are looking
      for the latest features or bugfixes this could be interesting
      for you.  In this case you should first take a look at <ulink
      url="http://om.filewatcher.org/mini-commander/">http://om.filewatcher.org/mini-commander/</ulink>
      to see if there is a new version at all.</para>

      <para>Perhaps you also want to take a look at the history (<xref
      linkend="history">) before or while downloading the sources.</para>

      <para>The currently known latest separate sources package is
      <ulink
      url="http://om.filewatcher.org/mini-commander/mini-commander_applet-0.0.14.tar.gz">http://om.filewatcher.org/mini-commander/mini-commander_applet-0.0.14.tar.gz</ulink>.</para>

      <para>But think twice before you download this package. The
      developement of GNOME is currently very fast. Probably this
      package will not even compile on your machine. Additionally Ryan
      Hayle reported that the Makefile is not being build correctly on
      his Debian 2.1 system.  This might be the case for all Debian
      2.1 systems.  I have heard that you have to compile
      autoconf/automake from scratch to fix this problem.  Perhaps it
      will be easier for you to get a package of the latest version of
      gnome-core which does already include mini-commander.</para>

      <title>Features</title>

    <sect1 id="starting-program">
      <title>Starting a Program</title> 

      <para>You can simply start any program by typing its name.</para>
    </sect1>

    <sect1 id="command-completion">
      <title>Command Completion</title> 

      <para>You often have not to enter the full name but only the
      first characters followed by the <keycap>tab</keycap>
      key. &mini-c; will try to complete the program name in the same
      way most UNIX shells do.</para>
    </sect1>

    <sect1 id="command-history">
      <title>Command History</title> 

      <para>The last commands can be recalled by pressing the
      <keycap>arrow-up</keycap> or <keycap>arrow-down</keycap>
      keys. This works like the command history in most UNIX
      shells.</para>

      <para>A command is not stored in the history when it is the same
      as the command before.  This way dupes are prevented.</para>
    </sect1>

    <sect1 id="macros">
      <title>Macros</title> 

      <para>&mini-c; has some predefined macros. For example if
      you enter "term:command" then "command" is executed in a
      terminal window. Or if you enter an URL then your web browser is
      used to view it.  Additionally you can define your own macros or
      change the predefined ones.</para>
    </sect1>

    <sect1 id="clock">
      <title>Clock</title> 

      <para>There is a built-in clock which can optionally show the
      date or can be completely disabled.</para>
    </sect1>

  <chapter id="faq">
    <title>Frequently Asked Questions</title> 

    <para>Here are listed some frequently asked questions and the
    answers to them.</para>

    <sect1>
      <title>Why am I not able to give  &mini-c; keyboard focus?</title> 

      <para>This is a confusing problem which seems to have several
      reasons and which occurs only under certain conditions.</para>

      <para>When you cannot give &mini-c; keyboard focus at all then
      this could be a problem with you window manager.  If this is
      true for you it would helpful if you write me a short mail and
      tell me what window manager you are using (name and
      version).</para>

      <para>Sometimes it happens that you can give keyboard focus to
      &mini-c; only for the first time.  After this it is impossible
      to focus it again.  Currently the reason for this bug is
      unknown.  Some people believe this could be a panel bug.</para>

      <para>Here is the description of the latter problem mentioned on
      the gnome buglist:</para>

** mini-commander applet
After losing focus, cannot get focus back into the GtkEntry. I think this
is a GtkPlug/GtkSocket bug, not sure. [1998-12-29]
