> is part of gnome-core.  So
      if you are happy with it as it is there is no need for you to
      download and compile separate sources.  Only if you are looking
      for the latest features or bugfixes this could be interesting
      for you.  In this case you should first take a look at <A
HREF="http://om.filewatcher.org/mini-commander/"
TARGET="_top"
>http://om.filewatcher.org/mini-commander/</A
>
      to see if there is a new version at all.</P
><P
>Perhaps you also want to take a look at the history (<A
HREF="history.html"
>Chapter 6</A
>) before or while downloading the sources.</P
><P
>The currently known latest separate sources package is
      <A
HREF="http://om.filewatcher.org/mini-commander/mini-commander_applet-0.0.12.tar.gz"
TARGET="_top"
>http://om.filewatcher.org/mini-commander/mini-commander_applet-0.0.12.tar.gz</A
>.</P
><P
>But think twice before you download this package. The
      developement of GNOME is currently very fast. Probably this
      package will not even compile on your machine. Additionally Ryan
      Hayle reported that the Makefile is not being build correctly on
      his Debian 2.1 system.  This might be the case for all Debian
      2.1 systems.  I have heard that you have to compile
      autoconf/automake from scratch to fix this problem.  Perhaps it
      will be easier for you to get a package of the latest version of
      gnome-core which does already include mini-commander.</P
