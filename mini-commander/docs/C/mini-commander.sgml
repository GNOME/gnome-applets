  <title>Mini-Commander Applet</title>

  <para>
   <application>Mini-Commander</application> applet, shown in <xref
   linkend="mini-commander-applet-fig">, adds a command line to your
   <interface>Panel</interface>. It features command completion,
   command history, changeable macros and an optional built-in clock.
   Because of the changeable macros you can use it for many different
   tasks. You can simply start a program (or a short macro) or view a
   web page or search for a man/info page
   etc. <application>Mini-Commander</application> can be detached from
   your <interface>Panel</interface> using an optional handler on the
   side, which is especially usefull for people who use vertical
   panels.

  <!-- ============= Usage  ================================ -->
  <sect2 id="APPLET-usage">
   <title>Usage</title>

   <para>
    To start a program or run a command, simply enter the program or
    command and press return. Or, to browse for an application or command
    in your filesystem, click on the small <guiicon>circle</guiicon>
    in the lower corner.
   </para>
   <para>
    <application>Mini-Commander</application> has command
    completion (similar to many other user shells).  Thus, you often
    have not to enter the full name but only the first few characters
    followed by the <keycap>tab</keycap>
    key. <application>Mini-Commander</application> will try to
    complete the program name in the same way most UNIX shells do. 
   </para>
   <para>
    <application>Mini-Commander</application> also has command
    history, which allows you to recall previous commands by pressing
    the <keycap>arrow-up</keycap> or <keycap>arrow-down</keycap>
    key. This works like the command history in most UNIX shells. Note
    that commands are not stored in the history if it is already
    present in the history in order to avoid duplication.  You may
    also access the history list by pressing the small <guibutton>down
    arrow icon</guibutton> in the applet and selecting a command from
    the history list.
   </para>
   <para>
    <application>Mini-Commander</application> has the ability to use
    macros. It has some predefined macros. For example if
    you enter
    <command>term:<replaceable>command</replaceable></command> then
    <command><replaceable>command</replaceable></command> is executed
    in a terminal window. Or if you enter an URL then your web browser is
    used to view it.  Additionally you can define your own macros or
    change the predefined ones.
   </para>

   <para>
    Right-clicking on the applet brings up a menu containing the
    following items:
    <itemizedlist>

     <listitem>

     The <guilabel>Macros</guilabel> tab consists of a list of up to
     99 macros, each of which is a regular expression
     (<guilabel>Regex</guilabel>) and a macro
     (<guilabel>Macro</guilabel>).  Enter the regular expression for
     <application>Mini-Commander</application> to match in the left
     column, and the corresponding macro which should be executed in
     the right column.  The default setting has many useful macros
     already defined, which may be helpful in learning to write your
     own macros.

       Why am I not able to give
       <application>Mini-Commander</application> keyboard focus?
      </para>
     </question>
     <answer>
      <para>
       This is a confusing problem which seems to have several reasons
       and which occurs only under certain conditions.
      </para>

      <para>
       If you cannot give <application>Mini-Commander</application>
       applet keyboard focus at all then this could be a problem with
       you window manager.  If this is true for you it would helpful
       if you write me a short mail and tell me what window manager
       you are using (name and version).
      </para>

      <para>
       Sometimes it happens that you can give keyboard focus to
      <application>Mini-Commander</application> applet only for the
      first time.  After this it is impossible
      to focus it again.  Currently the reason for this bug is
      unknown.
