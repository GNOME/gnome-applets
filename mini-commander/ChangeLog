	Steiner <josh@xiphoidprocess.com>].
	
	* src/mini-commander_applet.c (applet_pixel_size_changed_cb): Do
	not change show_frame status on startup.  This prevents that the
	preferences are ignored [fixes #9662 and #12458 reported by

2001-03-11  Timur Bakeyev  <mc@bat.ru>

	as the last one can use some system types.
	
2001-03-10  Timur Bakeyev  <mc@bat.ru>

	* src/exec.c: On some OS's none of the used signal flags do exist. Use
	zero as a default value. Also changed strcpy() to strncpy() in command

 	popup window.

	(show_message): better positioning of message popup window

	* src/command_line.c (command_line_activate_cb): Sometimes the
 	text entry does not get the keyboard focus although it should.

 	executing plain commands (non-macros)

2000-02-02  Oliver Maruhn  <oliver@maruhn.com>

1999-09-07  Oliver Maruhn  <oliver@maruhn.com>
