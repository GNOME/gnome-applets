   <title>The net load applet</title> 

   <para> 
     The <application>netload_applet</application> is a small monitor
     applet which sits in your panel and tells you about the load on
different network interfaces. 
   </para>
  
 
   <sect2 id="netload-usage">
    <title>Usage</title>
    <para>
      You don't need to do anything to this applet. It will sit and
      run in your panel. Various options to alter its display are
      available.

    <para>
      It displays details for four different types of network interfaces:
    </para>
    <variablelist>
     <varlistentry>
      <term>SLIP</term>
      <listitem>
       <para>
         SLIP is the serial line IP protocol. It is not commonly used
         any more, being largely replaced by PPP, but it is one way of
         connecting a computer to other machines which was popular for
         modems.
       </para>
      </listitem>
     </varlistentry>

     <varlistentry>
      <term>PPP</term>
      <listitem>
       <para>
         PPP is the Point to Point Protocol, for connecting one computer
         to another. It has largely replaced SLIP. It is effective and
         flexible but not as fast as ethernet. This is probably the most
         common way people connect from home to the internet.
       </para>
      </listitem>
     </varlistentry>

     <varlistentry>
      <term>ETH</term>
      <listitem>
       <para>
         Ethernet is another method for connecting machines together.
         It requires an ethernet card in the computer and a piece of
         ethernet cable connecting it to the other machine to talk to.
         It's a lot faster than PPP. 
       </para>
      </listitem>
     </varlistentry>

     <varlistentry>
      <term>Other</term>
      <listitem>
       <para>
         Other forms of networking are available, such as ways to
         talk over infra-red beams (IRDA), ways to talk over amateur
         radio (AX25), and token-ring networks. Anything the applet
         finds which is not SLIP, PPP or ethernet is monitored under
         'other'.
       </para>
      </listitem>
     </varlistentry>
    </variablelist>

    <para>
      If you have two interfaces of the same type running (for example,
      two ethernet interfaces talking to different machines), what is
      displayed is the sum total of the two. The applet will not divide
      it into two sections.

         applets.

    <para>
      Like several of the monitor applets,
      <application>netload_applet</application> has two ways of setting
      preferences. You can make changes that affect all of this applet group
      (<application>cpuload_applet</application>, <application>memload_applet</application>,
      <application>swapload_applet</application>, <application>netload_applet</application>
      and <application>loadavg_applet</application>) in one large dialogue
      box. This is useful if you run one or more of them. These are the
      settings used by default. They are reached from the
      <guimenuitem>Default Properties...</guimenuitem> menu item.

    <para>
      Or you can change just the properties for 
     <application>netload_applet</application>. This is useful for when
     you only use <application>netload_applet</application> or want to
     try new combinations out. It is reached from the 
     <guimenuitem>Properties</guimenuitem> menu item.
    </para>
    <note>
     <para>
      If you use the <guimenuitem>Properties...</guimenuitem> menu item
      and edit the preferences for just this applet, you must uncheck
      the <guibutton>Use default properties</guibutton> checkbox before
      you can alter any settings.

    <para>
      The changes you can make to the properties are three:
    </para>

    <variablelist>
     <varlistentry>
      <term>Colours</term>
      <listitem>
       <para>
         You can alter the colours used for the different network interfaces
         by clicking on the colour boxes. This invokes the GNOME colour wheel.
        </para>
       </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
       <term>Speed</term>
       <listitem>
        <para>
          You can alter the speed that the graph proceeds with this.
          It is measured in milliseconds. The default is 500.
        </para>
       </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
       <term>Size</term>
       <listitem>
        <para>
          You can alter the size of the applet with this. It is measured
          in pixels. The default value is 40, and the range is from 1 pixel
          to whatever you like. In a vertical panel, this refers to the
          height. In a horizontal panel, it refers to the width. 
        </para>

    <title> Known Bugs and Limitations</title>

      Resizing and then altering the panel orientation can still cause
      intermittent problems, although they now fix themselves after a
      short period.
