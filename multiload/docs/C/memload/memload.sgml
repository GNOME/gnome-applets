   <title>The memory load applet</title> 

   <para> 
     The <application>memload_applet</application> is a small monitor
     applet which sits in your panel and tells you how much memory is
     being used. 
   </para>
  
   <sect2 id="memload-usage">
    <title>Usage</title>
    <para>
      You don't need to do anything to this applet. It will sit and
      run in your panel. Various options to alter its display are
      available.
    </para>

    <para>
      The applet shows four different uses of memory:
    </para>
    <variablelist>
     <varlistentry>
      <term>Free</term>
      <listitem>
       <para>
         Free memory is memory which is not being used by any program.
         The default colour is green.
       </para>
      </listitem>
     </varlistentry>

     <varlistentry>
      <term>Buffers</term>
      <listitem>
       <para>
         Buffers hold data which has not yet been written to the disk.
         They also hold data which has been recently read from the disk,
         keeping it around in case it is needed again. The default colour
         is grey.
       </para>
      </listitem>
     </varlistentry>

     <varlistentry>
      <term>Shared memory</term>
      <listitem>
       <para>
         Shared memory is memory which more than one program is using.
         This is a very common thing to do on UNIX systems. Many GNOME
         programs use a lot of shared memory, which cuts down on the 
         total memory used. The default colour is yellow.
       </para>
      </listitem>
     </varlistentry>

     <varlistentry>
      <term>Other</term>
      <listitem>
       <para>
         Memory being used in other ways is shown in this category. The
         default colour is a greenish-yellow.

    <para>
      Like several of the monitor applets,
      <application>memload_applet</application> has two ways of setting
      preferences. You can make changes that affect any of this group of
      applets 
      (<application>cpuload_applet</application>, <application>memload_applet</application>,
      <application>swapload_applet</application>, <application>netload_applet</application>
      and <application>loadavg_applet</application>) in one large dialogue
      box. This is useful if you run one or more of them. These are the
      settings used by default. They are reached from the
      <guimenuitem>Default Properties...</guimenuitem> menu item.
    </para>

    <para>
      Or you can change just the properties for 
     <application>memload_applet</application>. This is useful for when
     you only use <application>memload_applet</application> or want to
     try new combinations out. It is reached from the 
     <guimenuitem>Properties</guimenuitem> menu item.
    </para>
    <note>
     <para>
      If you use the <guimenuitem>Properties...</guimenuitem> menu item
      and edit the preferences for just this applet, you must uncheck
      the <guibutton>Use default properties</guibutton> checkbox before
      you can alter any settings.

    <para>
      The changes you can make to the properties are three:
    </para>

    <variablelist>
     <varlistentry>
      <term>Colours</term>
      <listitem>
       <para>
         You can alter the colours used for the different categories of memory
         the applet displays by clicking on the colour boxes. This
         invokes the GNOME colour wheel.
        </para>
       </listitem> 
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
       <term>Speed</term>
       <listitem>
        <para>
          You can alter the speed that the graph proceeds with this.
          It is measured in milliseconds. The default value is 500.
        </para>
       </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
       <term>Size</term>
       <listitem>
        <para>
          You can alter the size of the applet with this. It is measured
          in pixels. The default value is 40, and the range is from 1 pixel
          to whatever you like. In a vertical panel, this refers to the
          height. In a horizontal panel, it refers to the width. 
        </para>

   <sect2 id="memload-bugs">
    <title> Known Bugs and Limitations</title>
    <para>
      Resizing and then altering the panel orientation can still cause
      intermittent problems, although they now fix themselves after a
      short period.
