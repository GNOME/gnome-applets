   <title>The swap load applet</title> 

   <para> 
     The <application>swapload_applet</application> is a small monitor
     applet which sits in your panel and tells you how much swap space is
     being used. 
   </para>
  
   <para>
     The swap space is a part of the hard drive which is not
     part of the filesystem. When the kernel decides a program in
     memory is not being used a lot but might be required soon, 
     it takes parts of the program out of memory and puts those into the 
     swap space, where it can easily retrieve it. Moving data between
     memory and swap can be slow, so if you are using a lot of your
     swap space, you may find the machine's reaction slows.
   </para>
 
   <sect2 id="swapload-usage">
    <title>Usage</title>
    <para>
      You don't need to do anything to this applet. It will sit and
      run in your panel. Various options to alter its display are
      available. 
    </para>
   </sect2>

   <sect2 id="swapload-right-click">
    <title>Right-Click Pop-Up Menu Items</title>
    <para> 
     In addition to the standard menu items, the right-click pop-up menu has 
     the following items: 
    </para>   

    <variablelist>
     <varlistentry>
      <term>Default Properties...</term>
      <listitem>
       <para>
         This opens the <guilabel>multiload_applet dialogue box</guilabel>
         <link linkend="swapload-properties">described below</link> which allows 
         you to alter the default properties of this and related monitor 
         applets.
       </para>
      </listitem>
     </varlistentry>

     <varlistentry>
      <term>Properties...</term>
      <listitem>
       <para>
         This opens the <guilabel>multiload_applet dialogue box</guilabel>
         <link linkend="swapload-properties">described below</link> which
         affects only the <application>swapload_applet</application>
         properties.
       </para>
      </listitem>
     </varlistentry>

     <varlistentry>
      <term>Run gtop...</term>
      <listitem>
       <para>
         This option will run the <command>gtop</command> which
         starts up the GNOME System Monitor. <application>gtop</application>
         gives a much more detailed look at your system and what's happening
         on it.

   <sect2 id="swapload-properties">
    <title>Properties</title>
    <para>
      Like several of the monitor applets,
      <application>swapload_applet</application> has two ways of setting
      preferences. You can make changes that affect all of this group 
      (<application>cpuload_applet</application>, <application>memload_applet</application>,
      <application>swapload_applet</application>, <application>netload_applet</application>
      and <application>loadavg_applet</application>) in one large dialogue
      box. This is useful if you run one or more of them. These are the
      settings used by default. They are reached from the
      <guimenuitem>Default Properties...</guimenuitem> menu item.
    </para>
    <para>
      Or you can change just the properties for 
      <application>swapload_applet</application>. This is useful for when
      you only use <application>swapload_applet</application> or want to
      try new combinations out. It is reached from the 
      <guimenuitem>Properties</guimenuitem> menu item.
    </para>
    <note>
     <para>
      If you use the <guimenuitem>Properties...</guimenuitem> menu item
      and edit the preferences for just this applet, you must uncheck
      the <guibutton>Use default properties</guibutton> checkbox before
      you can alter any settings.
     </para>
    </note>

    <para>
      The changes you can make to the properties are three:
    </para>

    <variablelist>
     <varlistentry>
      <term>Colours</term>
      <listitem>
       <para>
         You can alter the colours used for used and free swap space
         that are displayed by clicking on the colour boxes. This
         invokes the GNOME colour wheel.
        </para>
       </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
       <term>Speed</term>
       <listitem>
        <para>
          You can alter the speed that the graph proceeds with this.
          It is measured in milliseconds, and the default is 500.
        </para>
       </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
       <term>Size</term>
       <listitem>
        <para>
          You can alter the size of the applet with this. It is measured
          in pixels. The default value is 40, and the range is from 1 pixel
          to whatever you like. In a vertical panel, this refers to the
          height. In a horizontal panel, it refers to the width. 
        </para>
       </listitem>
      </varlistentry>
     </variablelist>
   </sect2>
  
   <sect2 id="swapload-bugs">
    <title> Known Bugs and Limitations</title>
    <para>
      Resizing and then altering the panel orientation can still cause
      intermittent problems, although they now fix themselves after a
      short period.
