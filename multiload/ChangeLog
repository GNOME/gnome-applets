	* netload.c (make_netload_applet): have netload use
	netload local properties instead of swapload's properties

2000-02-20  Martin Baulig  <martin@home-of-linux.org>

	Added a load average applet to the multiload applet.

	* loadavg.c: New file.
	* loadavg_applet.desktop: New file.

2000-02-20  Martin Baulig  <martin@home-of-linux.org>

	Changed most of the properties code from the multiload applet. We
	now have two types of properties: global properties (which you can
	configure using the "Default Properties" applet menu entry) and local
	ones (which you can configure using the "Properties" applet menu entry).

	Global properties are default values which are used for newly created
	instances of the load applets.

	Additionally, each of the load applet also has local properties which
	are only for this single instance. This means that you can now have
	two or more cpuload applets with different size, speed, etc. The
	local properties dialog also has a "use default properties" checkbox;
	if it is checked, the global properties are used.

	This is especially useful when you have more than one panel ...

	* local-properties.h: New file.
	* local-properties.c: New file.

	* *: Larger changes in the properties code to do what is
	described above.

2000-02-19  Martin Baulig  <martin@home-of-linux.org>

	Implemented panel size and orientation hints.

	* properties.h (LoadGraphProperties): `adj_data' is now
	an array of size 2, not 3.
	* load-graph.h (LoadGraph): Removed `width' and `height'.
	Added `applet', `size', `orient', `pixel_size' and `allocated'.
	* load-graph.c (load_graph_new): Replaced `width' and
	`height' parameters with `size' and added new `applet' parameter.

1999-12-07  Jacob Berkman  <jberkman@andrew.cmu.edu>

	* main.c: 
	* netload.c:
	* linux-proc.c: fix broken code.  Now this

	<100018135@alumnos.uc3m.es>

1999-09-26  Jacob Berkman  <jberkman@andrew.cmu.edu>

        menu item

Wed Apr  7 23:03:11 1999  Jacob Berkman <jberkman@cmu.edu>

	* load-graph.c (load_graph_properties_init): 
	Set the minimum values for update time and width to
	avoid lock up/crash

1999-02-22  Martin Baulig  <martin@home-of-linux.org>

	* multiload: Resize the widget after changing the size in the
	properties dialog. Add "destroy" signal handler to the load
	graph and correctly destroy it so it will no longer dump core
	when you remove on of the applets.

	* multiload: Applied the patch from Jacob Berkman that makes
	the multiload applet honor the width and height settings in
	the properties dialog on next startup.

1999-02-07  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* load-graph.c (load_graph_update): Now this is the

	properties for the correct part of the applet.
	(multiload_show_properties): Show the property page corresponding
	to the type of applet the user clicked on.

1998-12-28  Martin Baulig  <martin@home-of-linux.org>

	The "MultiLoad Applet Revolution".

	All three multiload applets (cpuload, memload, swapload) now use
	the same load graph object and the same properties code.

	This will make it much easier to add a new applet here.
