This probably does not need to be localized. However if it does need to be localized, the
following are the instructions:
1. Create an edge panel by right-clicking on the Menu Panel and choosing Create Panel -> Edge panel.
2. Right-click on the Edge panel and choose Add to Panel -> Utility -> Character Palette.
3. Take a screenshot of the desktop.
4. Crop the screenshot to include only the Character Palette applet.
5. Save the file in the PNG format.
