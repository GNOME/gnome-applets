	  buttons, and fixed some warnings

1999-08-20  Alexandre Owen Muniz  <munizao@cyberhighway.net>

	* charpick.h: defined CHARPICK_VERSION, incrementing the version number
	to 0.04 for the occasion.
	
	* charpick.c: removed some unused variables, changed the instances of 
	VERSION, (which references gnome-applets module version,) to 
	CHARPICK_VERSION. added a frame to the applet, which corrects the 
	buglet where it was impossible to see the applet borders on a blank 
	background panel.

1999-08-17  Alexandre Owen Muniz  <munizao@cyberhighway.net>

	* Makefile.am, charpick.png, charpick_applet.desktop: Added icon.

1999-08-12  Alexandre Owen Muniz  <munizao@cyberhighway.net>

	* charpick.c: added lists for all remaining ISO-8859-1 characters 
	that were not previously available.

	(about): use VERSION in about box

1999-05-07  Alexandre Owen Muniz  <munizao@cyberhighway.net>

	* charpick.c: fixed the bug where buttons created after changing the 
	properties did not pass button 2 and 3 clicks to the panel. Also fixed
	a bug where spurious data could be saved for the properties, and added 
	sanity checking to property_load().
	
1999-04-30  Alexandre Owen Muniz  <munizao@cyberhighway.net>


	* Makefile.am (charpick_applet_SOURCES): added charpick.h, properties.c
	
	* charpick.c: changed order of acute and grave accents to match 
	French alphabetical order. Added character lists for capital characters
	and some non-alphabet-related characters. Changed default size and 
	arrangement of buttons so that capital characters fit, and the applet
	does not violate the 48 pixel limit so egregiously. Split 
	build_table() out of main() so that the table can be rebuilt after 
	properties are changed. Fixed a number of spots in build_table() where
	"rows" and "cols: had been interchanged, which worked when rows==cols,
	but not now. Incremented version in about box to 0.03.

	* properties.c: adapted this file from modemlights/properties.c.
	It adds a properties dialog that allows one to change the size and 
	arrangement of buttons, and session management to store and load that 
	info. (some of this is in charpick.c as well.) The big remaining bug 
	is that the context menu does not appear when right-clicking a button 
	after rebuilding the table when changing the properties.

	* charpick.h: Split header like stuff off of charpick.c.

1998-12-16  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

1998-09-24  Nuno Ferreira  <nmrf@rnl.ist.utl.pt>
