	* gumma.[ch]: 
	cd/cdplayer.c: 
	gqmpeg/gqmpeg.c:
	xmms/xmms.c:  fast forward/rewind beginnings.  
	it really doesn't work very well at all.

	* gumma.c (clicked_cb): fix crashing-on-session-startup

	* gqmpeg/gqmpeg.c: add "show playlist" when eject
	is clicked
	(is_connected): set ifp=NULL when we close it

	* gumma.c (plugin_cb): select the first plugin

	* */*.*: rewrote to be a bit cleaner; hopefully
 	works nicer

	* new applet: plays CD's, xmms, gqmpeg
