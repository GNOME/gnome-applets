	* On an anti-warning hunt using CFLAGS="-O6 -g -W -Wall
        -Wmissing-prototypes -Wmissing-declarations". Don't mind me.

1999-09-12  Jacob Berkman  <jberkman@andrew.cmu.edu>

	* gqmpeg/gqmpeg.c (parse_input): when we have no
	input try to close/open again  (otherwise we loop
	infinitely)
	(parse_input): don't print out every string we get

1999-09-10  Jacob Berkman  <jberkman@andrew.cmu.edu>

	* xmms/Makefile.am (libgumma_xmms_la_LIBADD): it is
	bad to remove the trailing '\' in these lines.
	especially if your program is not robust in the
	error handling area

	* gumma.c (load_plugin): print a little note

	* gumma.[ch]: 
	cd/cdplayer.c: 
	gqmpeg/gqmpeg.c:
	xmms/xmms.c:  fast forward/rewind beginnings.  
	it really doesn't work very well at all.

1999-09-09  Jacob Berkman  <jberkman@andrew.cmu.edu>

	* gumma.c (clicked_cb): fix crashing-on-session-startup

	* gqmpeg/gqmpeg.c: add "show playlist" when eject
	is clicked
	(is_connected): set ifp=NULL when we close it

	* gumma.c (plugin_cb): select the first plugin

	* */*.*: rewrote to be a bit cleaner; hopefully
 	works nicer

1999-09-08  Jacob Berkman  <jberkman@andrew.cmu.edu>

	* new applet: plays CD's, xmms, gqmpeg
