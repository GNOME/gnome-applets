   <application>XMMS</application> is minimized or on a different
   screen.  To add this
   applet to a <interface>Panel</interface>, 
   right-click on the <interface>Panel</interface> and choose

   <title>Usage</title>
   <para>
    Double-click on the applet to start the main
    <application>XMMS</application> program.  This will also turn the
    <application>XMMS</application> applet into a tiny control panel,
    as shown in <xref linkend="xmms-buttons-fig">. Press these buttons
    as you would with a normal CD player, using the eject button to
    load songs. When you exit the main <application>XMMS</application>
    application, the appearance of the applet will return to its
    original (logo) appearance seen in <xref linkend="xmmsapplet-fig">.
