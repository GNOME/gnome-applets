The gnome diskusage applet.

Takes the output of df, and displays it in the panel.

Actually the newer version use GNU mountlist/fsusage directly, do get the info.
Thanks to Martin Baulig for the mod.
Also thanks to George, who made writting applets for the panel that easy.
Thanks to added Dave Finton for a patch added a sub-menu to the right-click 
menu that lists all the mounted filesystems.
