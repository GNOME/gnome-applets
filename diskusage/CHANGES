worst problem with this applet:
There are several small memory leaks in the applet, and due to my lack of
x/gtk/gnome knowledge i haven't fixed them yet.

This applet will slowly eat you memory (1/3 Meg. per hour ?)  ... so don't let it run for too long :]


+tooltip which show's you the mount-point's in text mode. I don't think that's
what tooltips are for normaly, it's sort of just a temporary solution
+ added bare bones of config dialog
+ i think i might have closed *some* of the memory-leaks, but opened new
ones :/
+diskusage_read now directly reads df-info via some stuff ripped out of
GNU-fileutils

v 003:
diskusage_read now reads from "df" via popen. 
I used temp. files to read df output before.

v 002:
horizontal/vertical bar's

v 001:
initial version
