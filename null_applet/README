What the hell is a Null Applet?
===============================

The Null Applet is the Applet Deprecation Applet. It allows us to remove applets
from a users configuration, without them getting cryptic messages about being
unable to resolve things, and getting a raw dump of preferences (the panel likes
to do this). In the future, the null applet will also be useful for when someone
decides not to build one of the optional applets, to prevent them from seeing
the same ugly message.

How do I add an applet to Null Applet?
======================================

You'll need the factory from the oaf_server, copy that server to
GNOME_NullApplet_Factory.server.in.in, set it's location to
GNOME_NullApplet_Factory. Remove it's panel:icon attribute so that it doesn't
appear in the add to panel list.

Who wrote this abomination?
