Ok. Lots of stuff to do. I mean lots.

In the meantime, you'll have to manually copy slashsplash.gif to 
/usr/share/pixmaps. This may be changed later.

You may have to do some manual Makefile hacking. All I claim is that they 
work for me.

So sit back, enjoy, and send me money, computer parts, and or diffs.
