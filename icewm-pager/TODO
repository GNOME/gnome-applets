TODO for wmpager_applet - May 23, 1998
--------------------------------------

* Properties dialog (What properties?)

* Work better when panel is vertical. Need to find out when panel
  orientation changes.

* Error checking for if users changes window managers and doesn't kill the
  applet by hand. (Only necessary if new wm is not GNOME aware)

* Fix funky error when number of workspaces is odd. The last button disables
  itself. Hmm...
                                                                           	
<DONE!>
* Check for desktop change from hotkeys or other sources, to keep the pager
  toggle buttons in sync with the actual current desktop.

<DONE!>
* Keep current desktop button from un-toggling when clicked twice.

<DONE!>
* Check to see if GNOME aware wm is running, if not, exit nicely.
