If you maintain one of these applets, feel free to commit.  Unless we're very
close to a release, so if you're not sure, contact us.

If you just want to hack, tell us about it.  Most of these applets are
unmaintained, but you should try to contact the maintainer (or past maintainer)
before doing much work on them to avoid stepping on anyones toes.  If unsure,
ask us.

(BTW, a note, you now need the xml-i18n-tools package, to build g-a)
