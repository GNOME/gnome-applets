f you are the maintainer of an applet, feel free to commit - unless we're 
very close to a release. In that case, contact us.

If you just want to hack, let us know. Most of the applets are unmaintained, 
but you should try to contact the maintainer (or past maintainer) before 
working on them, to avoid duplicate work and stepping on any toes. If unsure,
ask us about it.

Please attach your patches to a bug in bugzilla.gnome.org, either by filing
new bugs or attaching it to an old one.

Some tips for hacking/debugging the applets:
1) The Panel Applet Writer's Reference Manual, including the PanelApplet
library documentation, can be found at 
http://developer.gnome.org/doc/API/2.0/panel-applet/libpanel-applet.html,
or in gnome-panel/doc/reference/panel-applet (source). It is not
completely up to date, but it covers the basics of writing an applet.

2) Look at the other applet implementations. One of the simpler applets is
the fish applet, which lives in gnome-panel/applets/fish.

3) Read the article about debugging GNOME Applets at 
http://www.davyd.id.au/articles/debugging-gnome-applets.shtml.

4) Be weary of static, global variables if you plan to allow the user
to be able to add multiple instances of the applet. Each instance will
share the static varible. This is described in the debugging article, under
"Other considerations".

5) You'd probably want to run the applets from CVS, without nescessarily doing
the same with all of GNOME. To do this, install the applets from CVS to a
different prefix than the rest of GNOME, and change your bonobo servers 
directory to $prefix/lib/bonobo/servers. You'll find the config file by
running "bonobo-activation-sysconf --config-file-path". Add the directory to
as an <item> at the top of <searchpath>. Log out, run bonobo-slay and make
sure no bonobo processes are running. When you log in again, your applets
should be running from the new prefix.
Running single applets from CVS is described in the debugging article.
