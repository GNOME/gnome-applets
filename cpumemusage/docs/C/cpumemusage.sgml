  <title>The CPU and memory usage applet</title> 

  <para> 
    The <application>cpumemusage_applet</application> is a small monitor
    applet which sits in your panel and tells you about your machine's
    use of CPU, memory and swap.  To add this
    applet to a <interface>Panel</interface>, 
    right-click on the <interface>Panel</interface> and choose
    <menuchoice>
      <guimenu>Panel</guimenu>
      <guisubmenu>Add to panel</guisubmenu>
      <guisubmenu>Applet</guisubmenu>

   <sect2 id="cpumemusage-usage">
    <title>Usage</title>
    <para>
      You don't need to do anything to this applet. It will sit and
      run in your panel.
    </para>
    <para>
      The applet shows three bar charts, for CPU, memory and swap space. 
      If your panel is horizontal, the top bar is CPU, the middle is
      memory, and the bottom is swap. If your panel is vertical, the left
      bar is CPU, the middle is memory, and the right is swap.

      <listitem>
       <para>
         Three colours are used here. Yellow is used for CPU activity 
         which does not need the kernel. Grey is used for CPU activity 
         by programs talking to the kernel (typically, lots of I/O such
         as moving things between memory and disk). Black is the background
         and represents unused CPU. 
       </para>

     </varlistentry>
     <varlistentry>
      <term>Memory</term>
      <listitem>
       <para>
         Four colours are used here. Yellow is used for shared memory
         (memory more than one program is using). Grey is used for
         buffer use (memory containing data not yet written to disk).
         The greenish-yellow is used for other memory use. Green
         represents unused memory.
       </para>
      </listitem>
     </varlistentry>
     <varlistentry>
      <term>Swap</term>
      <listitem>
       <para>
         Two colours are used here. Red is used for swap space in use.
         Green is for unused swap. Swap is a section of the hard-drive
         where the kernel puts parts of programs which are not currently
         being used so that it can retrieve them easily when it needs to.
