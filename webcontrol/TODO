WebControl Applet TODO
----------------------

* Browser configuration interface

* TAB completion in URL bar

* autocompletion in URL bar

* allow selection of "Services", ie: Google search

* ability to configure Services
  * whether or not to show them in the menu
  * whether or not to store in the history

* have applet follow panel size

* have it select all text on a double-click

Bugs
----

* using default MIME handler breaks "launch in new window"

* might be a problem w/ order of loading/saving url history

* have to restart to move clear button

* currently, due to the way browser execution is assumed, 
  launching netscape in a new window will not work
