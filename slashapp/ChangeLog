	Apply patch from Richard Kinder.
	
	* display.c: Clean up styles when 'dark' gtk theme is used (applet
	always uses style->white_gc regardless of the font colour). Changed
	this to style->light_gc[0].
	
2001-07-02  Kjartan Maraas  <kmaraas@gnome.org>

	* slashapp.c: Replace the last strcasecmp call with its glib equivalent.
	
2001-06-26  Kjartan Maraas  <kmaraas@gnome.org>

	* *: Apply patch from Richard Kinder from bugzilla.
	Fixes #52869 plus a whole bunch of duplicates.

Wed Jun 19 20:00:00 2001  Richard Kinder <r_kinder@yahoo.com>

	* slashapp.c: clean up the info_current and info_next fields post
	'remove_all_lines' call. This stops crashes when clicking the refresh
	menu item, and crashes when clicking the 'articles' menu item during the
	refresh timeout (5 secs).
	* slashapp.h: remove unused GList current_text from AppData struct.
	Removed prototype for 'free_all_info_lines'
	* display.c: removed 'free_all_info_lines' and 'free_click_lists' since
	neither is currently used. 'remove_all_lines' modified so it walks the
	list of text InfoData's and cleans them up.

Fri Jun 22 12:17:13 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* slashapp.[ch], display.c: fix some memleaks and a bit of
	  constization

	  Add a gnotices logo (stolen from the website).  Also add an option
	  to actually load slashdot stories.  Also fix my yesterdays
	  braindamage to make this thing actually somewhat work.

Wed Nov 29 03:43:49 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* properties.c, slashapp.[ch], display.c:  Make this actually
	  somewhat work.  It's still broken but less.  It now at least
	  loads at the right size and doesn't give warnings.

2000-10-02  Christophe Merlet  <christophe@merlet.net>

	* slashapp.c : Added two strings for translations

2000-09-29  Justin Maurer  <justin@helixcode.com>

	* Modified slashapp.[ch] and display.c. "priority" is no longer 
	  an option for any functions. add_info_line was modified to 
          assign ad->text, not just ad->info_list. This causes the 
	  article to work once again. Hoorah! Proxy support draws near!
 
2000-09-27  Justin Maurer  <justin@helixcode.com>

	* Large changes to several files in order to support varying 
	  panel sizes. display.c was stolen from tick-a-stat. Proxy

	ad->draw_area->style->fg_gc[GTK_WIDGET_STATE(ad->draw_area)] to
