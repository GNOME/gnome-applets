1998-09-15  Martin Baulig  <martin@home-of-linux.org>

	* modemlights.c (is_ISDN_on): Added function body for Linux.

Mon Sep 14 04:52:29 1998  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* modemlights.[ch], properties.c: Added foundation for ISDN, but there
	is no code in the is_ISDN_on() function. Added an advanced tab to the
	properties, move modem lock file entry there, added Device entry
	option and a Use ISDN checkbox. Changed default update interval to 5.
	* modemlights.c(is_ISDN_on): let me repeat that this function is empty,
	could someone with the knowledge (ie: ISDN) fix this?
	* version bumped to 0.3.2

1998-09-06  Raja R Harinath  <harinath@cs.umn.edu>

	* Makefile.am: Remove CXXLINK hack.

Wed Jul 29 19:49:11 1998  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* modemlights.c  (about_cb): fixed a compile warning.
	(main):  Properties is now above About in the menu.
	* properties.c (property_apply_cb): added
	applet_widget_sync_config() as George suggested
	* modemlights.[ch], properties.c: Upped version to 0.3.1
	* AUTHORS: new file

1998-07-19  Raja R Harinath  <harinath@cs.umn.edu>

	* Makefile.am (modemlights_applet_LDADD): s/MICO_LIBS/ORB_LIBS/g.

1998-07-04  Carsten Schaar  <nhadcasc@fs-maphy.uni-hannover.de>

	* modemlights.c (main): Now uses stock menu icons.

Tue Jun 16 23:03:49 1998  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* modemlights.c (draw_load): Really (hopefully) fixed the problem.

Sun Jun 14 07:08:42 1998  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* modemlights.c (draw_load): Fix problem of drawing outside of
	the load window.
	(applet_change_orient): Declare first_call_flag as type int.

Mon Jun  1 13:27:30 1998  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* modemlights.c (command_connect_cb): Use gnome_execute_shell, 
	because not all connect scripts terminate immediately. e.g. the
	Debian script doesn't exit until hangup.
	(command_disconnect_cb): Likewise.
	* Changelog: Renamed to ChangeLog. Added this entry, and Mark
	Galassi's entry from the applets directory.

1998-06-01  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@cygnus.com>

	* modemlights/properties.c (property_load): introduced a
	"confirmation" property to be saved and loaded.  It doesn't save
	yet :-)
	(confirm_checkbox_cb):
	(property_show): added a confirmation checkbox to the properties
	dialog.

	* modemlights/modemlights.c (dial_cb): introduced the
	ask_for_confirmation configuration variable.  Now we only enter
	the yes/no dialog if that variable is true; otherwise we just fire
	off the connect (or disconnect) script.

1998-05-28  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* modemlights[c.h], properties.c: added dialing, load, tooltip.
	Many additions, so bumped version up to 0.3.0

1998-05-27  Seth Alves  <alves@twitch.cp.domain.net>

	* modemlights/modemlights.c (update_display):
	  added #ifdef FreeBSD's so it would compile

1998-05-19  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* dummy.cc: This file is generated, removed from CVS.
	* backgrnd_s.xpm: Added image for left/right panel orientation.
	* modemlights.c: Added orientation code.

1998-05-19  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* modemlights.c: (main) The orientation callback was being called
	before the widgets were created, causing a warning at startup.
	signal_connect for "orient" relocated to after widget creation.
