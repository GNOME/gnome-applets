2002-02-02  Kjartan Maraas  <kmaraas@gnome.org>

	* properties.c: Make green the default for both TX and RX.
	
2001-07-07  Kjartan Maraas  <kmaraas@gnome.org>

	* modemlights.c: Applied patch from Red Hat to define
	  MAX_ISDN_CHANNELS if not already done.
	  
2001-07-03  Kjartan Maraas  <kmaraas@gnome.org>

	* modemlights.c: Applied patch for proper size negotiation
	with the panel. Removes flicker on add applet to panel.
	
Mon Jan 22 11:10:14 2001  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* modemlights.c: Applied ISDN patch from Nils Philippsen, ChangeLog
	entry is below. Also fixed a compile warning in pixmap_set_colors().

2001-01-21  Nils Philippsen <nils@wombat.dialup.fht-esslingen.de>

	* modemlights.c (is_ISDN_on): fix to work with Linux kernel 2.4,
	glibc 2.2 and providers with long phone numbers

Wed Nov 15 18:23:30 2000  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* modemlights.[ch], properties.c: Added color configuration. Made the
	blinking when waiting for a connection optional (default is off),
	since the wait color is now different from the 'on' color.

Mon Nov  6 11:27:03 2000  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* modemlights.c (update_tooltip): Added connect time and description of
	byte counts to the tooltip, also marked it for translation.

Thu Oct 26 14:43:45 2000  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* modemlights.c(get_modem_stats): Apparently the FreeBSD/OpenBSD
	#ifdefs were doing it the right way, SIOCDEVPRIVATE is by name private.
	Now this should work on FreeBSD, etc. without the #ifdef's. Also fixed
	when SIOCGPPPSTATS is undefined to return failure (FALSE) instead of
	success. Added include of <linux/if_ppp.h> on linux.

Mon Oct 23 22:17:28 2000  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* modemlights.c: The connect light now blinks until the
	connection is established (rx or tx has a byte count other than 0), or
	if ppp status returns error. This should/might work for ISDN too?
	(get_modem_stats): Fixed, I did not see how this could possibly compile
	cleanly when SIOCDEVPRIVATE is not defined.

Mon Oct 23 16:15:45 2000  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* modemlights.[ch], properties.c: Some const stuff, fix apply_cb
	parameters.

Tue Sep 26 14:18:51 2000  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* modemlights.c (dial_cb): Use gnome_execute_shell in place system()
	call, which blocks on the call. Who used this? I sure hope it
	wasn't me :O. Fixes BUG #16815

Tue Sep 26 13:33:16 2000  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* modemlights.c: Applet layout coordinates are now stored in a static
	structure for each possible layout. Added layouts for connection info
	with a tiny/small panel. Note that the vertical tiny panel is simply
	too narrow to fit the byte rate and time, so the applet is still going
	to enlarge the panel to 30 pixels (not as bad as before, at 46 pixels).

Tue Sep 26 10:46:49 2000  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* modemlights.[ch], properties.c: Added button in properties advanced
	tab to save current options as default, this way the default start
	options can be saved even if the applet is removed from the panel
	(or it crashes :).
	* modemlights.c (main): Moved _show() of applet to after
	reset_orientation(), hoping to clear up some start-up problems peeps
	were having with display corruption.

2000-04-25  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gmx.net>
	
	* modemlights_applet.desktop : Added [tr] section . 

2000-04-04  Jacob Berkman  <jacob@helixcode.com>

	* properties.c (phelp_cb): use correct anchor

2000-03-25  Jacob Berkman  <jacob@helixcode.com>

	* properties.c (property_show): make help work with new docs

2000-02-29  Jacob Berkman  <jacob@helixcode.com>

	* modemlights.c (main): rearrange and add a pixmap to the help
	item

2000-02-23 Peter Hawkins <peterhawkins@ozemail.com.au>

	* modemlights.c: stopped the about box from being shown multiple times at once.

Sat Jan 29 18:10:10 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* On an anti-warning hunt using CFLAGS="-O6 -g -W -Wall
        -Wmissing-prototypes -Wmissing-declarations". Don't mind me.

Tue Jan 04 04:21:28 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* modemlights.c: add another patch from Nils Philippsen
	  <nils@wombat.dialup.fht-esslingen.de>, this time to get ISDN
	  connection time.  Fixes #4893

Tue Jan 04 02:28:49 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* modemlights.c: apply patch by Nils Philippsen
	  <nils@wombat.dialup.fht-esslingen.de> to fix bug #4894, (the
	  modemlights confirmation dialog vanishing bug)

Sun Oct 31 17:12:43 1999  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* modemlights.c: use the pixel size stuff

Fri Oct 29 00:31:20 1999  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* modemlights.c: Switched sd and rd lights (send is now first). Receive
	light is now red to match load graph.
	* properties.c: Minor formatting change.

Fri Oct 22 17:21:20 1999  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* modemlights.c: Added #ifdef's around panel size code, it should
	now compile with 1.0.x of gnome-core.

Sat Aug 28 15:34:30 1999  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* modemlights.c: Use gdk_draw_*() functions to create the applet's
	display layout. This way the color scheme can be made to match the
	gtk theme in use (match the applet's style).
	* backgrnd.xpm, backgrnd_a.xpm, backgrnd_s.xpm, button_off.xpm,
	button_on.xpm, lights.xpm: Removed, generated internally now.
	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Remove references to above xpm files.

1999-08-23  Matthias Warkus  <mawa@iname.com>

	* modemlights_applet.desktop: Use gnome-modem.png.

Wed Jul 14 21:15:44 1999  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* properties.c: Group related options into frames. Use GNOME_PAD_*
	instead of hard coded values.

Sun Jul 11 23:30:46 1999  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* modemlights.[ch]: Use the gnome-applets defined VERSION.
	* modemlights.c, properties.c: If /dev/modem does not exist, fall back
	to LCK..ttyS0 as a default for the lock file. Many newer distros do not
	create /dev/modem.

Sun May 30 22:20:53 1999  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* modemlights.c: Make it follow the panel's size hint. When
	'show throughput/connect time' is enabled, the size hint is ignored,
	this is really unavoidable.
	* modemlights.h: Bump version to 1.0.3 to distinguish from released
	versions.

1999-04-25  Ettore Perazzoli  <ettore@comm2000.it>

	* modemlights.h: #include <config.h>.

	* modemlights.c (main): Initialize i18n.

Mon Apr 12 19:49:33 1999  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* modemlights.h: added #include <time.h>

Tue Mar 30 19:29:38 1999  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* modemlights.c: Fix display bugs after disconnect.

Tue Mar 30 11:51:16 1999  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* modemlights.[ch], properties.c: Added an optional connect time and
	throughput display.
	Based on the patch from
	Bruno Abrunhosa Pires Marinho <bapm@camoes.rnl.ist.utl.pt>
	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Added backgrnd_a.xpm and digits.xpm.

Sun Mar 28 07:23:52 1999  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* modemlights.[ch], properties.c: Apparently some systems have broken
	lockfiles (no pid stored inside), add option to disable lockfile
	owner verification.
	Bump internal version to 1.0.2

Tue Mar  9 19:30:37 1999  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* modemlights.h: Internal version bumped to 1.0.1

1999-03-09  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* modemlights.h: Add OpenBSD support.  Patch from Kenneth Stailey
	<kstailey@kstailey.tzo.com>.

Tue Mar  9 18:13:23 1999  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* modemlights.c (main): Fixed startup position problem when panel is
	verticle.
	(applett_change_orient): Remove static variable, no longer needed.
	This fixes BUG #519

Tue Mar  9 17:43:34 1999  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* modemlights.c (is_Modem_on): Check for stale modem lock files.

Mon Feb  8 06:48:04 1999  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* modemlights.[ch], properties.c: Version to 0.99.0, updated
        copyrights to 1999.

1999-02-07  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* modemlights.c (get_modem_stats): Patch from Matt Mosley
	<mattm@igloo.org> to make modemlights work on OpenBSD.

1999-01-18  Nat Friedman  <nat@nat.org>

	* properties.c (property_show): Use gnome_app_id to find the
 	applet name for the root help directory.

1999-01-18  Nat Friedman  <nat@nat.org>

	* properties.c (property_show): Connect the help signal of the
 	GnomePropertyBox to gnome_help_pbox_display.

1999-01-12  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* modemlights.c (get_modem_stats): Fix to compile in more
	operating systems.  It is still useless though.

Sat Sep 19 08:13:31 1998  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* properties.c: Grey out device and lockfile entries when ISDN is
	selected.

1998-09-18  Martin Baulig  <martin@home-of-linux.org>

	* modemlights.c (get_ISDN_stats): Added ISDN statistics for Linux.

1998-09-15  Martin Baulig  <martin@home-of-linux.org>

	* modemlights.c (is_ISDN_on): Added function body for Linux.
	(get_stats, get_modem_stats, get_ISDN_stats): New functions.
	Use them to get modem statistics; things are a little bit different
	if we are using ISDN, but currently it's empty.

Mon Sep 14 04:52:29 1998  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* modemlights.[ch], properties.c: Added foundation for ISDN, but there
	is no code in the is_ISDN_on() function. Added an advanced tab to the
	properties, move modem lock file entry there, added Device entry
	option and a Use ISDN checkbox. Changed default update interval to 5.
	* modemlights.c(is_ISDN_on): let me repeat that this function is empty,
	could someone with the knowledge (ie: ISDN) fix this?
	* version bumped to 0.3.2

1998-09-06  Raja R Harinath  <harinath@cs.umn.edu>

	* Makefile.am: Remove CXXLINK hack.

Wed Jul 29 19:49:11 1998  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* modemlights.c  (about_cb): fixed a compile warning.
	(main):  Properties is now above About in the menu.
	* properties.c (property_apply_cb): added
	applet_widget_sync_config() as George suggested
	* modemlights.[ch], properties.c: Upped version to 0.3.1
	* AUTHORS: new file

1998-07-19  Raja R Harinath  <harinath@cs.umn.edu>

	* Makefile.am (modemlights_applet_LDADD): s/MICO_LIBS/ORB_LIBS/g.

1998-07-04  Carsten Schaar  <nhadcasc@fs-maphy.uni-hannover.de>

	* modemlights.c (main): Now uses stock menu icons.

Tue Jun 16 23:03:49 1998  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* modemlights.c (draw_load): Really (hopefully) fixed the problem.

Sun Jun 14 07:08:42 1998  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* modemlights.c (draw_load): Fix problem of drawing outside of
	the load window.
	(applet_change_orient): Declare first_call_flag as type int.

Mon Jun  1 13:27:30 1998  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* modemlights.c (command_connect_cb): Use gnome_execute_shell, 
	because not all connect scripts terminate immediately. e.g. the
	Debian script doesn't exit until hangup.
	(command_disconnect_cb): Likewise.
	* Changelog: Renamed to ChangeLog. Added this entry, and Mark
	Galassi's entry from the applets directory.

1998-06-01  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@cygnus.com>

	* modemlights/properties.c (property_load): introduced a
	"confirmation" property to be saved and loaded.  It doesn't save
	yet :-)
	(confirm_checkbox_cb):
	(property_show): added a confirmation checkbox to the properties
	dialog.

	* modemlights/modemlights.c (dial_cb): introduced the
	ask_for_confirmation configuration variable.  Now we only enter
	the yes/no dialog if that variable is true; otherwise we just fire
	off the connect (or disconnect) script.

1998-05-28  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* modemlights[c.h], properties.c: added dialing, load, tooltip.
	Many additions, so bumped version up to 0.3.0

1998-05-27  Seth Alves  <alves@twitch.cp.domain.net>

	* modemlights/modemlights.c (update_display):
	  added #ifdef FreeBSD's so it would compile

1998-05-19  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* dummy.cc: This file is generated, removed from CVS.
	* backgrnd_s.xpm: Added image for left/right panel orientation.
	* modemlights.c: Added orientation code.

1998-05-19  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* modemlights.c: (main) The orientation callback was being called
	before the widgets were created, causing a warning at startup.
	signal_connect for "orient" relocated to after widget creation.
