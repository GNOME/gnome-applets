	* modemlights.c (command_connect_cb): Use gnome_execute_shell, 
	because not all connect scripts terminate immediately. e.g. the
	Debian script doesn't exit until hangup.
	(command_disconnect_cb): Likewise.
	* Changelog: Renamed to ChangeLog. Added this entry, and Mark
	Galassi's entry from the applets directory.

1998-06-01  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@cygnus.com>

	* modemlights/properties.c (property_load): introduced a
	"confirmation" property to be saved and loaded.  It doesn't save
	yet :-)
	(confirm_checkbox_cb):
	(property_show): added a confirmation checkbox to the properties
	dialog.

	* modemlights/modemlights.c (dial_cb): introduced the
	ask_for_confirmation configuration variable.  Now we only enter
	the yes/no dialog if that variable is true; otherwise we just fire
	off the connect (or disconnect) script.

1998-05-28  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* modemlights[c.h], properties.c: added dialing, load, tooltip.
	Many additions, so bumped version up to 0.3.0

	* modemlights/modemlights.c (update_display):
	  added #ifdef FreeBSD's so it would compile

1998-05-19  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* dummy.cc: This file is generated, removed from CVS.
	* backgrnd_s.xpm: Added image for left/right panel orientation.
	* modemlights.c: Added orientation code.

1998-05-19  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* modemlights.c: (main) The orientation callback was being called
	before the widgets were created, causing a warning at startup.
	signal_connect for "orient" relocated to after widget creation.
