1999-07-11  Jacob Berkman  <jberkman@andrew.cmu.edu>

	* gnomepager_applet.c (main): move the warning dialog to after
	applet_widget_new() so we can applet_widget_remove() and not
	leave blank space on the panel

Wed Jun 02 00:58:06 1999  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* gnomepager_applet.c: added an option (on by default) not to have
	  the growing task list move other applets around, but only to eat
	  up space that is free, doing this I found that the geometry options
	  are very very weird and only really act nice in horizontal mode

Tue Jun 01 01:53:05 1999  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* gnomepager.h: removed

	* gnomepager_applet.c: ran through indent and sanitised small
	  portions of the code, added the patch from Grant Likely
	  <grantlikely@home.com>, added tooltips, and generally tried
	  to change some things more to my style and tried to figure
	  out what will be possible for reuse in a rewrite

Mon Apr 19 13:37:37 1999  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@redhat.com>

	* gnomepager_applet.c (get_task_stacking): Fixed leak
	of list nodes.

1999-04-17  Martin Baulig  <martin@home-of-linux.org>

	* gnomepager_applet.c (config): Added `pager_w_0', `pager_h_0',
	`pager_w_1' and `pager_h_1' and use it instead of the constants
	PAGER_W_0 etc.
	(cp_applet_properties): Made them configurable here.

Mon Apr 12 16:27:06 1999  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@redhat.com>

	* gnomepager_applet.c (cb_applet_properties): Connect
	signals after creating _all_ toggle buttons, otherwise,
	setting one radio button can cause another to change,
	triggering a segfault.

Sun Apr 04 04:31:35 1999  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* gnomepager_applet.c: new window is made as GDK_WINDOW_TEMP,
	  instead of the thing being uninitialized

Thu Mar 25 03:23:37 1999  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* gnomepager_applet.c: applied patch from
	  Erik Bagfors <bagfors@hpc2n.umu.se>, to add "show only
	  minimized" option, then I cleaned up the properties dialog
	  and added an option to show only normal tasks (no minimized)

Tue Mar 16 00:42:01 1999  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* gnomepager_applet.c: add option to keep minimized windows on
	  all the desktops

	Wainwright (prw@wainpr.demon.co.uk).

Mon Mar 08 18:37:08 1999  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* gnomepager_applet.c: when tasklist is of fixed size, make sure the
	  holding box is resized so that the buttons don't become too large
	  when the number of processes goes down

Mon Mar 08 18:30:24 1999  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* gnomepager_applet.c: fix adding/removing of the arrow/prop buttons
	  by keeping a ref of them all the time

Mon Mar 08 10:07:45 1999  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* gnomepager_applet.c: dialogs are destroyed automatically, plus
	  use error dialog for the "no hints" dialog, thanks to
	  Damon Chaplin <damon@karuna.freeserve.co.uk> for pointing it out

Sun Mar 07 00:59:11 1999  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* gnomepager_applet.c: fix minor leak from my previous commit

Sat Mar 06 22:34:06 1999  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* gnomepager_applet.c: more efficent algorithm for getting the short
	  string names, don't always create and populate popbox, but do it
	  on demand when actually needed, get rid of gnome_popup for menus
	  and make the popup menu handcoded and created on demand to reduce
	  memory usage and cpu usage (this also seems to fix leaking)

Sat Mar 06 20:56:48 1999  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* gnomepager_applet.c: added a hack so that one can drag the applet
	  by the properties/arrow buttons, and in a desparate attempt to find
	  memory leaks slightly cleaned up small parts of the code fixing
	  only one leak

Sat Mar 06 18:34:17 1999  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* gnomepager_applet.c: shut up warning and switch order of changed
	  signal bindings on the spinbuttons to avoid calling
	  property_box_changed prematurely

Tue Feb 23 00:39:35 1999  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* gnomepager_applet.c: default to small pagers as the default is
	  two rows, which just doesn't look right with large pagers :)

Mon Feb 22 14:48:58 EST 1999 The Rasterman <raster@redhat.com>

	* gnomepager_applet.c: added "property" checking so WM can detect that
	  the pager is runign and disable icons & tasks & pager if needed.
	  
Sun Feb 21 14:40:38 1999  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	  and the pager is working correctly on the alpha

Sun Feb 21 02:24:25 1999  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* gnomepager_applet.c,gnomepager.h: when doing XSelectInput on
	  our own windows, get their previous event mask, all the hints
	  that deal with 32bit quantities are now CARD32's, and while I
	  was at it, I couldn't help myself and cleaned up the config
	  dialog to not use zillions of functions and the init_gui
	  functions are combined ... for a grand total of about 200 less
	  lines of code

Sat Feb 20 19:59:22 1999  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* gnomepager_applet.c,gnomepager.h: added an option to make tasklist
	  constant size, for people that hate their panel appelts jumping
	  around when they even just change desktops

Wed Feb 17 01:50:07 1999  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* gnomepager_applet.c: fix the session loading which I have
	  previously skillfully broken

Sun Feb 14 21:01:10 1999  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* gnomepager_applet.c,gnomepager.h: event handlers have to return a
	  TRUE/FALSE, timeouts have to return a TRUE/FALSE, session is
	  supposed to be saved in save_session signal handler, removed some
	  utterly useless code, change init to work on panels of all
	  orientations, don't show the applet until the first orient change
	  signal (which is during init), don't pass null to gtk_label_new

Thu Feb 11 22:25:40 EST 1999 The Rasterman <raster@redhat.com>

        * gnomepager_applet.c: Added more efficient desktop redraw and
	  tasklist redraw (only redraws if changed and delays redraws
	  of desktop display until all "changes" have taken place)
	  Added width setting for task list if verticalm fixed options
	  taking effect beforte apply hit, added desktop area support for
	  "show all tasks".

	* gnomepager_applet.c (set_task_info_to_button): When switching to

 	GTK_STATE_NORMAL to indicate that it doesn't have the focus
 	anymore.

1999-01-10  Jay Painter <jpaint@serv.net>

	* gnomepager_applet.c: fixed bug where the pager would get
