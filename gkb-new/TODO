- HELP if there will be a help system
- get lang and country from the tree
- fix sizing appearance bug

the gnome_config stuff will need to be ported to

shooby: I'm gonna #if 0 the save session stuff
you are right... maybe I should put save somewhere

kevinv: do you know about gtk_tree_model_get instead 
of _get_value - it's easier to use

S kevinv: should I force it to use the old config path? :(((
K shooby: you shouldn't do that. It should be possible to have
  seperate instances of the applet running with different configs
S kevinv: that's ok, but few month ago I got a nice patch to gkb in 1.4 what
  made this with gnome_config
K shooby: if you want to save values as global configs you can do the gconf
  stuff yourself and save to 

<kevinv> shooby: GtkImage with GdkPixbuf is pretty easy to use
