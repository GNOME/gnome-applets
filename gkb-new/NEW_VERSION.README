So. This is a new idea, but not the final version. This contains bugs from
the original gkb version, and from the bad idea to hack the dinamic lists of
gtk_notebook... So I'll write an another code with control-center capplet
and CORBA-based messaging. I hope I'll write it to 2.0 ...

 This version will include keyboard command based switching, presets, new
property box...
