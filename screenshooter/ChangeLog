2000-03-01  Andreas Hyden  <ahyden@staffanstorp.net>

	* screenshooter_applet.c: Changed the pixmap on the help item
	from an about pixmap to a help pixmap.

Fri Feb 25 14:33:56 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* Being nice to xgettext. (Thanks to <sarantis@gallagher.di.uoa.gr>)

2000-02-23 Peter Hawkins <peterhawkins@ozemail.com.au>

	* Stopped about box from being shown multiple times at once.

Mon Feb 21 23:44:01 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* The "App to view screenshots with" option wasn't being saved.

Mon Feb 14 18:47:01 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* Oops. Fixed something I broke in my earlier excitement. (The
	spurious options panels never show up :( )
	* Plumbed in some documentation. It took me about a month to get
	around to this, because I am so lame. ;)

Fri Feb  4 23:50:00 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* /me looks at code he wrote a year ago
	* /me blushes
	* /me shaves a coupla thousand lines out of the source
	* (and its still ugly)

Tue Feb  1 22:22:45 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* Filled in FIXMEs in the sgml helpfile. Still not plumbed it in
	to install yet...

Sun Jan 30 00:54:15 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* Added a button and callback to show the result of
	shell-expanding the filename string. This lets people use magic
	shell huju to generate unique filenames, (ala the default), and
	see how it looks first.

Sat Jan 29 18:33:19 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* On an anti-warning hunt using CFLAGS="-O6 -g -W -Wall
        -Wmissing-prototypes -Wmissing-declarations". Don't mind me.

Sat Jan 29 01:13:03 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* Added the sgml docs from Telsa to the repo. I won't "plumb them
	in" until after 1.2 is out, what with the freeze and
	everything. Also, I need to fill in the FIXMEs.

Wed Jan 26 21:27:45 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* Enable i18n. Thanks to Yuusuke Tahara <m5021212@u-aizu.ac.jp> for
	pointing out my omission :)

Tue Jan 25 23:40:54 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* Oh look. I seem to be still alive. That's cool then ;)
	* Responding to numerous requests from Telsa Gwynne
	<hobbit@aloss.ukuu.org.uk> to fix my awful grammar. My grammar's
	fine when I'm not coding, *honest* =P

2000-01-19  Jacob Berkman  <jacob@helixcode.com>

	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): don't install INSTALL
	add some files to EXTRA_DIST

2000-01-02  ERDI Gergo  <cactus@cactus.rulez.org>

	* screenshooter_applet.c (cb_properties_dialog): use a
	GnomeFileEntry for selecting output directory

Sun Oct 31 17:19:05 1999  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* screenshooter_applet.[ch]: use pixel size stuff

Sat Oct 30 17:38:40 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* Whoops. Replace a couple of stray snprintf()s with
	g_snprintf()s.
	* Fix one of the options not sticking (beep)

1999-10-29  Jacob Berkman  <jberkman@andrew.cmu.edu>

	* screenshooter_applet.h: #include <config.h> and un #define VERSION

Fri Oct 29 19:22:56 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* Syncing with my local copy

1999-10-29  Jacob Berkman  <jberkman@andrew.cmu.edu>

	* new applet
