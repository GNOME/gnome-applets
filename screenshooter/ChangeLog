    * I'm back! Who says I don't answer bug reports? :-)
    * Okay, someone needs to be shot. A cut-and-paste error was very
      apparent in the gnome-config stuff. The keys for saving change halfway
      from "screenshooter/key" to "screenshoter/key", meaning changes were
      lost between sessions.
    * The scary thing is how long I stared blankly at this damn thing before
      noticing.
    * The really scary thing is that the typo might have been me.
      "cvs annotate" implicates jberkman, but he may have just innocently
      re-indented my evil...
    * I hope I can sleep tonight...

2000-08-09  Dan Mueth <d-mueth@uchicago.edu>

    * screenshooter_applet.c: Updated URL for author's website

2000-05-14  Andreas Hyden  <a.hyden@cyberpoint.se>

2000-05-05  Yukihiro Nakai <nakai@gnome.gr.jp>

	* screenshooter_applet.desktop: Add 'ja'.

2000-05-02  Telsa Gwunne <hobbit@aloss.ukuu.org.uk>

	* docs fixes: corrected even more markup. Split the docs into two:
	screenshooter-applet.sgml and screenshooter.sgml: one includes the
	other as an entity. This brings it in line with the other applets 
	for doc-building. 

2000-04-16  Karl EICHWALDER  <ke@suse.de>

	* screenshooter_applet.desktop: Add de.

2000-04-04  Kjartan Maraas  <kmaraas@online.no>

	* screenshooter_applet.c: Added "xgettext:no-c-format" comment
	to please gettext. Also fixed the string in question so
	that the comment is recognized by gettext.
	
2000-04-04  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gmx.net>

	* screenshooter_applet.desktop : Added the
		Turkish translation .

	* screenshooter_applet.c (main): reorder menus

2000-03-30  Jacob Berkman  <jacob@helixcode.com>

	* screenshooter_applet.c (showHelp): be like the others

2000-03-29  Alexander Kirillov  <kirillov@math.sunysb.edu>

	* screenshooter.sgml: added "bugs" section mentioning problems
	with Netscape and PNG. 

2000-03-28  Alexander Kirillov  <kirillov@math.sunysb.edu>

	* screenshooter.sgml: changed the docs to follow GDP guidelines:
	changed docs license to FDL, added "Authors" section, cleaned up
	sgml markup. Practically did not change  the content.  

2000-03-01  Andreas Hyden  <ahyden@staffanstorp.net>

	* screenshooter_applet.c: Marked a string for translation.

2000-03-01  Andreas Hyden  <ahyden@staffanstorp.net>

	from an about pixmap to a help pixmap.

Fri Feb 25 14:33:56 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* Being nice to xgettext. (Thanks to <sarantis@gallagher.di.uoa.gr>)

2000-02-23 Peter Hawkins <peterhawkins@ozemail.com.au>

	* Stopped about box from being shown multiple times at once.

Mon Feb 21 23:44:01 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* The "App to view screenshots with" option wasn't being saved.

Mon Feb 14 18:47:01 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* Oops. Fixed something I broke in my earlier excitement. (The
	spurious options panels never show up :( )
	* Plumbed in some documentation. It took me about a month to get
	around to this, because I am so lame. ;)

Fri Feb  4 23:50:00 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* /me looks at code he wrote a year ago
	* /me blushes
	* /me shaves a coupla thousand lines out of the source
	* (and its still ugly)

Tue Feb  1 22:22:45 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* Filled in FIXMEs in the sgml helpfile. Still not plumbed it in
	to install yet...

Sun Jan 30 00:54:15 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* Added a button and callback to show the result of
	shell-expanding the filename string. This lets people use magic
	shell huju to generate unique filenames, (ala the default), and
	see how it looks first.

Sat Jan 29 18:33:19 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* On an anti-warning hunt using CFLAGS="-O6 -g -W -Wall
        -Wmissing-prototypes -Wmissing-declarations". Don't mind me.

Sat Jan 29 01:13:03 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* Added the sgml docs from Telsa to the repo. I won't "plumb them
	in" until after 1.2 is out, what with the freeze and
	everything. Also, I need to fill in the FIXMEs.

Wed Jan 26 21:27:45 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* Enable i18n. Thanks to Yuusuke Tahara <m5021212@u-aizu.ac.jp> for
	pointing out my omission :)

Tue Jan 25 23:40:54 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* Oh look. I seem to be still alive. That's cool then ;)
	* Responding to numerous requests from Telsa Gwynne
	<hobbit@aloss.ukuu.org.uk> to fix my awful grammar. My grammar's
	fine when I'm not coding, *honest* =P

2000-01-19  Jacob Berkman  <jacob@helixcode.com>

	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): don't install INSTALL
	add some files to EXTRA_DIST

	GnomeFileEntry for selecting output directory

	* screenshooter_applet.[ch]: use pixel size stuff

Sat Oct 30 17:38:40 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* Whoops. Replace a couple of stray snprintf()s with
	g_snprintf()s.
	* Fix one of the options not sticking (beep)

1999-10-29  Jacob Berkman  <jberkman@andrew.cmu.edu>

	* screenshooter_applet.h: #include <config.h> and un #define VERSION
