   <para>
     <application>Screen-Shooter</application> is a handy little 
     screengrabber which is simple to use:

       Clicking on the bottom or right-hand <interface>panel</interface>

       Clicking on the top or left-hand <interface>panel</interface> 
       <guibutton>button</guibutton> with <mousebutton>mouse button one

       or an area for <application>Screen-Shooter</application> to grab. 
     </para>
     <para>    
       If you want to select a single <interface>window</interface>, 
       click the mouse in it. If you want a different area, click and drag 
       the mouse to select a rectangle, then release it.

   <para>
     <application>Screen-Shooter</application> can be configured to do a 
     number of different things. The preferences dialogue has seven sections 
     covering these. Five of these occur initially: two more are available
     from the first section.

       <para>
         This <guilabel>checkbox</guilabel> controls whether or
         not the <interface>title-bar</interface> and edges of a 
         <interface>window</interface> are included. It is only relevant
         when <application>Screen-Shooter</application> is taking a 
         picture of a single <interface>window</interface> rather than of
         the whole screen or of a rectangle you have selected. The default is 
         for this to be checked and for the <interface>title-bar</interface>
         and window borders to be included in the shot.

       <para>
         This is a <guilabel>checkbox</guilabel> which controls whether
         some of <application>Screen-Shooter</application>'s more esoteric
         options are available. The default is off (ie they are not
         available). Checking this option makes two sections called 
         <link linkend="spurious-1">Spurious 1</link> and 
         <link linkend="spurious-2">Spurious 2</link> visible
         in the preferences dialogue.

      <term>Delay before taking shot</term>
      <listitem>
       <para>
         When taking shots of the <interface>desktop</interface>, you can 
         set a delay between pressing the <interface>panel</interface>
         <guibutton>button</guibutton> and the shot being taken. The delay
         can be up to one second. This can be very useful when you want to 
         focus on a particular <interface>window</interface> or if you want to
         bring up a <interface>menu</interface>.

      <term>Compression quality</term>
      <listitem>
       <para>
         Compression quality does not refer to how tightly a file is
         compressed, but to how well it retains detail after
         compression. The higher the compression quality, the better
         the quality of the image, but the larger the size of the resulting 
         file. It is relevant when you are saving something as a JEPG,
         a MIFF or a PNG file. The default compression quality is 75%.

     <varlistentry>
      <term>Create monochrome image</term>
      <listitem>
       <para>
         A fairly self-explanatory option: if this is selected,
         the resulting image will be in monochrome. This is off by default.
       </para>

     </varlistentry>
 
     <varlistentry>
      <term>Invert colours in image</term>
      <listitem>
       <para>
         Another self-explanatory option: if this is selected, the colours 
         of the image are reversed so that white becomes black, pale purple 
         becomes greenish, and so on. Lovely. Off by default.

      <term>Directory to save file in</term>
      <listitem>
       <para>
         The directory to save the shot in must exist already:
         <application>Screen-Shooter</application> will not create
         it for you. If you try to save it to somewhere that does 
         not exist, then nothing will happen. The default directory 
         is <filename>~/</filename>: your home directory.

      <term>Filename for images</term>
      <listitem>
       <para>
         <application>Screen-Shooter</application> will try to give each
         created shot a name which is based on the time it was taken. 
         The default filename is 
         <filename>`date +%H%M%S_%d-%m-%y`_screenshot.jpg</filename>.
         Everything inside the backticks is interpreted as a command.
         So it makes up a name based on the date, using the format the
         percentage symbols and letters tell it. Then it adds the rest
         of the name from outside the backticks to the date it has used.
         Explanations of the cryptic percentage symbols can be found
         in <command>man date</command>, but the arguments in the
         default filename are:

       <para>
         If your filename suffix is not something <application>Screen-Shooter
         </application> recognises, it will save the shot as a MIFF
         file. This may not be what you want. By changing the suffix, you
         change the format it saves in.

         This <guilabel>checkbox</guilabel> is unchecked by default. After
         checking it, you will get a view of the shot once it has been

         This is the quality of compression to use. As with the general
         preferences, the better the quality of the compression, the more
         detail will be preserved, and the bigger the thumbnail will be.

      <para>
        This is the prefix to attach to the thumbnail filename to distinguish
        it from the full-size shot. If you leave this blank, the 
        thumbnail will overwrite the full-size shot and you will lose
        the full-size one. The default prefix is "thumb-".

      <listitem>
      <para>
        This <guilabel>checkbox</guilabel> is off by default. It generates
        a MIFF image whilst making the thumbnail. A 'lossy' file format
        refers to a file format where data and detail is irretrievably
        lost, but which is typically much smaller than a non-lossy
        format image of the same thing. The typical example of a 
        lossy file format is JPEG.

         This <guilabel>checkbox</guilabel> enables you to adjust the
         gamma. The gamma value is a value to do with the intensity
         of the lightness of an image (and rather complicated). The
         range <application>Screen-Shooter</application> provides is
         from 0.8 to 2.3 with a default of 1.6. This is not a linear
         (straight) scale so you will need to experiment. Lowering the 
         gamma produces a darker image. Raising it produces a lighter one.

         This <guilabel>checkbox</guilabel>is off by default and the

         monochrome image with a slight smudginess which increases

         where, rather than highlighting areas of different colours, it
         highlights the edges and borders between areas of different
         colour. Very interesting on maps and astronomical photos. The

         CPU cycles like mad for ten minutes on a reasonably powerful
         machine. The maximum radius is 100, but you will need either
         a large machine or a lot of patience for that.

       <para>
         This <guilabel>checkbox</guilabel> is off by default and the
         factor is set to zero. Solarising is an effect first noticed 
         in developing photographs from negatives. It results in a 
         negative image with different colouring from that of the
         "inverted colours" option in the general preferences. A
         solarise factor of 5 will produce startling results, but the 
         maximum factor is 100.

       <para>
         This <guilabel>checkbox</guilabel> is off by default and the
         factor is set to zero. The result of spreading the image
         pixels by a radius of about 5 is similar to looking through
         lightly frosted glass; for heavily-frosted glass, try 25.
         The maximum is 100.

      <listitem>
       <para>
         This <guilabel>checkbox</guilabel> is off by default and the
         factor is set to zero. Swirling the pixels results in a
         distorted image similar to an imploded image except that it 
         swirls around the central point rather than stretching to
         it. A radius of 20 produces an effect like a fairground distorting 
         mirror, only not a mirror-image; 90 a much increased version 
         (although text is still legible); at 180 the entire image is 
         warped; and at the maximum of 360 a spiral effect is created.
