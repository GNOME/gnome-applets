   <para>
     <application>Screen-Shooter</application> is a handy little 
     screengrabber which is simple to use. It sits in your panel
     and you can click on it to take a screenshot of either the
     whole desktop or just a single window.

     To add the applet to your <interface>panel</interface>, you can
     right-click on an empty part of the <interface>panel</interface>

         Compression quality does not refer to how tightly a file is

         compression. The higher the compression quality, the better
         the quality of the image, but the larger the size of the resulting 
         file. It is relevant when you are saving something as a JPEG,
         a MIFF or a PNG file. The default compression quality is 75&percnt;.

      <listitem>
       <para>
         <application>Screen-Shooter</application> is designed to allow the
	 user maximum flexibility in naming each shot. The filename field
	 (as well as the directory field) is passed to a shell for normal
	 shell expansion before being used. This allows you to use the
	 output of programs, scripts or environment variables to name your
	 shots. The reason for this is to allow unique filenames.
	 By default, Screen-Shooter will create a name which is based on 
         the time and date it was taken: this of course should always be
	 unique. The default filename is 
         <filename>`date +&percnt;Y_&percnt;m_&percnt;d_&percnt;H&percnt;M&percnt;S`_shot.jpg</filename>.
         As you can see, the filename includes the output of the date
	 command in order to generate a datestamp.
         So it makes up a name based on the date, using the format the
         percentage symbols and letters tell it. Then it adds the rest
         of the name from outside the backticks to the date it has used.
         Explanations of the cryptic percentage symbols can be found
         in <command>man date</command>, but the arguments in the
         default filename are:

      <listitem>
       <para>
         The <guibutton>blur image</guibutton> checkbox is off by default and 
         the blur factor is set to zero. By checking the checkbox and altering
         the blur factor you can blur the image. Even at the highest
         rating (100), a typical font on a typical terminal window is
         still just about decipherable.

       <para>
         The <guibutton>charcoal</guibutton> checkbox is off by default and
         the charcoal factor is set to zero. Charcoaling produces a
         monochrome image with a slight smudginess which increases
         with the charcoal factor. It does not deal with highlighted
         text very well, though. The maximum factor for this is 100.

       <para>
         The <guibutton>find edges</guibutton> checkbox is off by default and 
         the factor is set to zero. Using it produces a monochrome image
         where, rather than highlighting areas of different colours, it
         highlights the edges and borders between areas of different
         colour. Very interesting on maps and astronomical photos. The
         maximum factor for this is 100.

         The <guibutton>implode image</guibutton> checkbox is off by default 
         and the factor is set to zero. Using it warps the resulting 
         screenshot as if a weight had been pressed into the centre of the 
         shot. The maximum factor for this is 100.

      <term><guilabel>Create painted effect</guilabel></term>
      <listitem>
       <para>
         The <guibutton>painted effect</guibutton> checkbox is off by default 
         and the radius to paint around each pixel is set to zero. Checking 
         it with a radius of about 5 produces an effect like an Impressionist
         painting. Checking it with a radius of about 50 will eat your
         CPU cycles like mad for ten minutes on a reasonably powerful
         machine. The maximum radius is 100, but you will need either
         a large machine or a lot of patience for that.

       <para>
         The <guibutton>solarise</guibutton> checkbox is off by default and 
         the factor is set to zero. Solarising is an effect first noticed 
         in developing photographs from negatives. It results in a 
         negative image with different colouring from that of the
         "inverted colours" option in the general preferences. A
         solarise factor of 5 will produce startling results, but the 
         maximum factor is 100.

       <para>
         The <guibutton>spread image</guibutton> checkbox is off by default 
         and the factor is set to zero. The result of spreading the image
         pixels by a radius of about 5 is similar to looking through
         lightly frosted glass; for heavily-frosted glass, try 25.
         The maximum is 100.

       <para>
         The <guibutton>swirl pixels</guibutton> checkbox is off by default 
         and the factor is set to zero. Swirling the pixels results in a
         distorted image similar to an imploded image except that it 
         swirls around the central point rather than stretching to
         it. A radius of 20 produces an effect like a fairground distorting 
         mirror, only not a mirror-image; 90 a much increased version 
         (although text is still legible); at 180 the entire image is 
         warped; and at the maximum of 360 a spiral effect is created.

       Often screenshots saved in PNG format show incorrectly in
