   <para>
     <application>Screen-Shooter</application> is a handy little 
     screengrabber which is simple to use:

       Clicking on the bottom or right-hand <interface>Panel</interface>

       Clicking on the top or left-hand <interface>Panel</interface> 
       <guibutton>button</guibutton> with <mousebutton>mouse button one
       </mousebutton> allows you to select a <interface>window</interface> 
       or an area for <application>Screen-Shooter</application> to grab. 
       If you want to select a single <interface>window</interface>, 
       click the mouse in it. If you want a different area, click and drag 
       the mouse to select a rectangle, then release it.

   <para>
     <application>Screen-Shooter</application> can be configured to do
     a number of different things. To configure
     <application>Screen-Shooter</application>, click on the applet
     with mouse button 3 (usually, right mouse button) and select
     <guimenuitem>Properties</guimenuitem> from the
     <guimenu>popup</guimenu> menu. The
     <interface>Preferences</interface> dialogue has seven sections
     described below. Five of these are visible initially: two more
     sections are available from a toggle in the first section.

         options are available. The default is off (i.e., they are not

         <link linkend="preferences-5">Spurious 1</link> and 
         <link linkend="preferences-5">Spurious 2</link> visible

         <guibutton>button</guibutton> and the shot being taken. The delay
         can be up to one minute. This can be very useful when you want to

      <term><guilabel>Compression quality</guilabel></term>
      <listitem>
       <para>
         Compression quality does not refer to how tightly a file is
         compressed, but to how well it retains detail after
         compression. The higher the compression quality, the better
         the quality of the image, but the larger the size of the resulting 
         file. It is relevant when you are saving something as a JPEG,
         a MIFF, or a PNG file. The default compression quality is 75%.

      <term><guilabel>Create monochrome image</guilabel></term>

       <para>
         A fairly self-explanatory option: if this is selected,
         the resulting image will be in monochrome. This is off by default.

      <term><guilabel>Invert colours in image</guilabel></term>
      <listitem>
       <para>
         Another self-explanatory option: if this is selected, the colours 
         of the image are reversed so that white becomes black, pale purple 
         becomes greenish, and so on. Lovely but rarely useful. Off by default.

      <listitem>
       <para>
         The directory to save the shot in must exist already:
         <application>Screen-Shooter</application> will not create
         it for you. If you try to save it to somewhere that does 
         not exist, then nothing will happen. The default directory 
         is <filename>~/</filename>: your home directory.

      <term><guilabel>Filename for images</guilabel></term>
      <listitem>
       <para>
         <application>Screen-Shooter</application> is designed to allow the
	 user maximum flexibility in naming each shot. The filename field
	 (as well as the directory field) is passed to a shell for normal
	 shell expansion before being used. This allows you to use the
	 output of programs, scripts or environment variables to name your
	 shots. The reason for this is to allow unique filenames, if the
	 user desires. By default, Screen-Shooter will create a name which
	 is based on the time and date it was taken. This should always be
	 unique.
         The default filename is 
         <filename>`date +%Y_%m_%d_%H%M%S`_shot.jpg</filename>.
         As you can see, the filename includes the output of the date
	 command, in order to generate a datestamp.
         So it makes up a name based on the date, using the format the
         percentage symbols and letters tell it. Then it adds the rest
         of the name from outside the backticks to the date it has used.
         Explanations of the cryptic percentage symbols can be found
         in <command>man date</command>, but the arguments in the
         default filename are:

       <para>
         The filename suffix determines the filetype. Screen-Shooter
	 supports what can only be described as a ridiculous number of
	 different image formats. Try your luck. For a full list, type
	 <command>man convert</command>. You can even try .html to create a
	 client-side image map, and wild things like that.

       <para>
         If your filename suffix is not something <application>Screen-Shooter
         </application> recognises, or you omit one, it will save the shot as a MIFF

        This <guibutton>checkbox</guibutton> is off by default. It generates
        a MIFF image whilst making the thumbnail. A 'lossy' file format
        refers to a file format where data and detail is irretrievably
        lost, but which is typically much smaller than a non-lossy
        format image of the same thing. The typical example of a 
        lossy file format is JPEG.

         from 0.8 to 2.3 with a default of 1.6. This is not a linear
         (straight) scale so you will need to experiment. Lowering the

       <para>
         This <guibutton>checkbox</guibutton>is off by default and the 
         charcoal factor is set to zero. Charcoaling produces a
         monochrome image with a slight smudginess which increases
         with the charcoal factor. It does not deal with highlighted
         text very well, though. The maximum factor for this is 100.

       <para>
         This <guibutton>checkbox</guibutton>is off by default and the
         factor is set to zero. Using it produces a monochrome image
         where, rather than highlighting areas of different colours, it
         highlights the edges and borders between areas of different
         colour. Very interesting on maps and astronomical photos. The
         maximum factor for this is 100.

         This <guibutton>checkbox</guibutton> is off by default and the

         as if a weight had been pressed into the centre of the shot.
         The maximum factor for this is 100.

       <para>
         This <guibutton>checkbox</guibutton> is off by default and the
         radius to paint around each pixel is set to zero. Checking it
         with a radius of about 5 produces an effect like an Impressionist
         painting. Checking it with a radius of about 50 will eat your
         CPU cycles like mad for ten minutes on a reasonably powerful
         machine. The maximum radius is 100, but you will need either
         a large machine or a lot of patience for that.

      <listitem>
       <para>
         This <guibutton>checkbox</guibutton> is off by default and the
         factor is set to zero. Solarising is an effect first noticed 
         in developing photographs from negatives. It results in a 
         negative image with different colouring from that of the
         "inverted colours" option in the general preferences. A
         solarise factor of 5 will produce startling results, but the 
         maximum factor is 100.

       <para>
         This <guibutton>checkbox</guibutton> is off by default and the
         factor is set to zero. The result of spreading the image
         pixels by a radius of about 5 is similar to looking through
         lightly frosted glass; for heavily-frosted glass, try 25.
         The maximum is 100.

       <para>
         This <guibutton>checkbox</guibutton> is off by default and the
         factor is set to zero. Swirling the pixels results in a
         distorted image similar to an imploded image except that it 
         swirls around the central point rather than stretching to
         it. A radius of 20 produces an effect like a fairground distorting 
         mirror, only not a mirror-image; 90 a much increased version 
         (although text is still legible); at 180 the entire image is 
         warped; and at the maximum of 360 a spiral effect is created.

      Often screenshots saved in PNG format show incorrectly in
      Netscape or GNOME Help Browser. This is due to bugs in Netscape
      (and GNOME image libraries), not bugs in

      compression level in <link
