    <para>
     The <interface>Properties</interface> dialogue is divided in two
     sections, one for general options and one for themes.
    </para>

    <para>
     The properties in the <guilabel>General</guilabel> tab are:
     <itemizedlist>

      <listitem>
       <para>
        Display time in 12 hours format (AM/PM) &mdash;  Check this
        button to show the time in 12-hour format. 
       </para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
       <para>
        Display time relative to GMT (Greenwich Mean Time) &mdash;
        This allows you to change the timezone
        <application>Clock and Mailcheck</application> 
        uses.  The time can be anything from twelve hours
        ahead of GMT to twelve hours behind it. Remember also to select
        the <guibutton>checkbox</guibutton>, to use the new
        timezone. Note that you can only alter the
        time by an integral number of hours.
       </para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
       <para>
        Mail file  &mdash; Enter you email inbox file which should be 
        checked for new mail. Typically, this is
        <filename>/var/spool/mail/yourusername</filename>
        or something similar. You can only enter one file.
       </para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
       <para>
        When new mail is received, run... &mdash; It is possible to
        execute commands when new mail arrives. 
        For example, it is very common for people to have a sound
        file played as mail arrives. You can put the command to 
        run and the file to run it on in this space and ensure the
        checkbox is checked for it to occur.
        If you have more than one command, you can separate them
        by a semi-colon. For example,
        <itemizedlist>
         <listitem>
          <para>
           <command>esdplay /full/path/to/file.wav</command>
          </para>
         </listitem>
         <listitem>
          <para>
           <command>cd /path/to/directory ; esdplay file.wav</command>
          </para>
         </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
        These two have the same effect. You will need the full path
        for this, without using shortcuts such as <command>cd ~</command>.
       </para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
       <para>
        Always blink when new mail is waiting &mdash; If you select
        this <guibutton>checkbox</guibutton>, then the 
        red envelope will blink until you read your unread email. Normally,
        this is off, and the blinking lasts only a few seconds.
       </para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
       <para>
        Number of messages to consider mailbox full &mdash; Set the
        number of messages you mailbox must have to be considered
        <quote>full</quote>.  Certain themes will show a special
        symbol indicating the mailbox is full.
       </para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
       <para>
        When clicked, run... &mdash; When this is set, clicking
        the left mouse button on the applet will run a program. The default is
        to run the <application>Balsa</application> mail client. (If
        <application>Balsa</application> is not installed, nothing
        will happen.) Set this to be your favorite email program.
       </para>
      </listitem>

     </itemizedlist>
    </para>

    <para>
     The properties in the <guilabel>Theme</guilabel> tab allows you
     to set the appearance of <application>Clock and
     Mailcheck</application> applet. <application>Clock and
     Mailcheck</application> applet comes with many themes which are
     stored in  <filename>$PREFIX/clockmail/</filename>. By 
     default, it does not use a theme. Note that not all of the themes
     show both the time and the state of your mailbox.

        You can't change the time through the clock properties. This
        is not really a bug; it's because you must be root to alter 
        the time for the whole of the system, using the <command>
        date</command> command.
      </para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <para>
        If you adjust the system clock backwards using the <command>
        date</command> command, the clock will stop working until the
        system time reaches the time the clock displays. It will start
        working normally then.
      </para>
