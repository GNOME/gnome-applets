   <para>
     The GNOME <application>Clock and mail notify applet</application>
     (or <application>clockmail_applet</application> for short)
     is an applet which shows you the current time and how much mail is
     in your mailbox currently. When more mail arrives, it flashes.
   </para>
   <para>
     Until October GNOME it was in gnome-core, but it is now distributed
     with gnome-applets. This part of the guide refers to the applet
     as distributed in gnome-applets-1.1.2.
   </para>     
   <para>
     To add the <application>clockmail_applet</application> to your panel,
     you can click <mousebutton>mouse button 3</mousebutton> on an
     empty part of the <interface>panel</interface> and follow the
     sequence:
    <menuchoice>
     <guimenu>Applets</guimenu>
     <guisubmenu>Clocks</guisubmenu>
     <guimenuitem>Clock and Mailcheck</guimenuitem>
    </menuchoice>
     or you can type the following command at a command line:
     <command>clockmail_applet --activate-goad-server=clockmail_applet</command>

    <para>
      You don't need to do anything special to this clock. It will just
      sit on your panel and tell you the time and how much mail is in
      your mail inbox. Various options are available with the 
      mouse:

    <orderedlist>

      <para>
        Pressing the <mousebutton>left</mousebutton> mouse button brings up
        a <guilabel>tooltip</guilabel> which shows the current date.
        It may also start up another program (tyically Balsa, the mail
        client) for you if this option has been selected in the general
        <link linkend="clockmail-prefs">preference window</link>.

      You can customize the <application>ClockMail</application>
      applet by right-clicking on it and choosing
      <guimenuitem>ClockMail Settings</guimenuitem>. This will open the
      <link linkend="clockmail-prefs-fig"><interface>Properties</interface> dialog</link>
      , which allows you to change various settings.
      The <interface>Properties</interface> dialogue (which calls
      itself <quote>ClockMail Settings</quote> rather than Properties) is divided
      in two sections, one for general options and one for themes.

            When this <guibutton>checkbox</guibutton> is selected, the

            You can change the timezone <application>mailclock_applet</application>

            the small <guibutton>arrow buttons</guibutton> to scroll
            through the options. The time can be anything from twelve hours
            ahead of GMT to twelve hours behind it. Remember also to apply
            the <guibutton>checkbox</guibutton>, as otherwise the new
            timezone will not be used. Note that you can only alter the
            time by whole hours.

            This is the file that is checked for new mail. It will
            probably say <filename>/var/spool/mail/yourusername</filename>
            or something similar. If you filter or move mail into another
            place, you will have to fill it in here. You cannot list
            multiple files. The applet will only look at one file.

          <para>
            It is possible to make things happen when new mail arrives.
            For example, it is very common for people to have a sound
            file played as mail arrives. You can put the command to 
            run and the file to run it on in this space and ensure the
            <guibutton>checkbox</guibutton> is checked for it to occur.
            If you have more than one command, you can separate them
            by a semi-colon. For example,
          </para>
          <itemizedlist>
           <listitem>
            <para>
              <command>esdplay /full/path/to/file.wav</command>
            </para>
           </listitem>
           <listitem>
            <para>
              <command>cd /path/to/directory ; esdplay file.wav</command>
            </para>
           </listitem>
          </itemizedlist>
          <para>
             These two have the same effect. You will need the full path
             for this, without using shortcuts such as <command>cd ~</command>.
          </para>

         <listitem>
          <para>
           If you select this <guibutton>checkbox</guibutton>, then the
           graphic will blink until you read your unread email. Normally,
           this is off, and the blinking lasts a few seconds only.

         <listitem>
          <para>
            If the mailbox is full, some themes will show this. This
            setting lets you choose how much email means 'full'.

            When this is set, clicking <mousebutton>button 1</mousebutton>
            of the mouse on the applet will run a program. The default is
            to run the Balsa mail client (if it is installed. If it is
            not installed, nothing will happen). If you don't want anything
            to be run, just delete whatever is in this box.

         <filename>$PREFIX/clockmail/</filename>. By 
         default, it uses none of them. Note that not all of them show both
         the time and the state of your mailbox. Some display only one of
         those. Just click on a theme and then on the <guilabel>Apply</guilabel> 
         box to change it.

        You can't change the time through the clock properties. This
        is not really a bug; it's because you must be root to alter 
        the time for the whole of the system, using the <command>
        date</command> command.

        If you adjust the system clock backwards using the <command>
        date</command> command, the clock will stop working until the
        system time reaches the time the clock displays. It will start
        working normally then.
