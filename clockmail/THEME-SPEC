a theme for clockmail contains the following:

* the theme is contained within a directory.
* the layout and filenames for images are specified in a file
  name clockmaildata (see the example included in the source)
* Only the Background image is required, all other items are
  optional. eg: you can omit seconds, or even the mail part if
  you only want a clock, or vice-versa.
* a clockmaildata file contains 1 or 2 sections. [Horizontal] is
  required, [Vertical] is used if the theme supports orientation.
  Both sections support all the flags below.

Internationalization:
  Item_* types support internationalization by adding another tag
  to the clockmaildata file and supplying a suitable image.
  Example:
    To internationalize A day of week item for 'es' do this:

    keep the default line:     Item_Week_Text=week.png 2 20
    and add a translated line: Item_Week_text[es]=weekes.png
        (do not add coordinates to the translated lines)

  Note: the translated image should be the same size as the default,
        and in the case of Item_Mail must contain the same number
        of animation frames.
