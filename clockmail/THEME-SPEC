a theme for clockmail contains the following:

* The theme is contained within a directory.
* The layout and filenames for images are specified in a file
  named clockmaildata (see the example included in the source).
* Only the Background image is required, all other items are
  optional. eg: you can omit seconds, or even the mail part if
  you only want a clock, etc.
* A clockmaildata file contains 1 or 2 sections. [Horizontal] is
  required, [Vertical] is used if the theme supports orientation.
  Both sections support all the flags below. To specify a setup for
  the other panel size, append "_Tiny", "_Small", "_Large", or
  "_Huge" when specifying the respective section. For example
  [Horizontal_Small] would be the heading for Small panel size when
  horizontal.
* Any Image can contain an alpha (transparency) channel, multiple level
  alpha is supported (ala PNG, the recommended image format)

Internationalization:
  Item_* types support internationalization by adding another tag
  to the clockmaildata file and supplying a suitable image.
  Example:
    To internationalize A day of week item for 'es' do this:

    Keep the default line:     Item_Week_Text=week.png 2 20
    and add a translated line: Item_Week_text[es]=weekes.png
        (do not add coordinates to the translated lines)

  Note: The translated image should be the same size as the default,
        and in the case of Item_Mail must contain the same number
        of animation frames.
