Fri Sep 29 18:57:00 2000  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* Syncing current version into CVS, an edited copy of the ChangeLog
        is below.
	Summary of Changes: Moved to gdk-pixbuf for images, this applet will
	now do alpha blending over the panel's background. Added themes with
	transparency: clock-digital-black/red, nice_clock, and nice_mailcount.
	Also broke everything into it's own file with header.

	--

	* update.c: Added emacs vm hack in mail counter.
	* pixbuf_ops.c: Fix off by ones ??, and make rotate function a little
	faster/cleaner.

	--

	* THEME-SPEC: Updated.

	--

	* clock.c, def_theme.c, item.c, number.c, skin.c, theme.c: Fixes for
	gdk-pixbuf 0.7.0 API.

	--

	* pixbuf_ops.[ch]: Updated to newer copy_area funcs.
	* clock.c, item.c, number.c, skin.c: Change to use newer arguments
	to pixbuf_copy_area{_alpha}().

	--

	* skin.c (applet_skin_backing_sync_idle): Add an idle callback to fix
	the 'new skin doesn't sync to background' bug. Workaround, true problem
	seems to be that a do_draw signal is missed (not sent) after a resize.

	--

	* clockmail.c: Fix SIZEHINT bug, missing else statement.
	* skin.c: Fall back to tiny if small not defined.
	* themes/calendar/[*]: Smoothed round edges, fixed week text, and added
	small size definition.
	* themes/nice_mailcount/[*]: Added small size definition, fix up
	others.

	--

	* clockmail.[ch], theme.c: Split code into smaller files, reworked
	all graphics ops to use GdkPixbuf structures. Result is transparency
	and alpha support for all images. Very nice for numbers too!
	Added support for the PANEL_SIZE_SMALL state.
	* button.[ch], clock.[ch], def_theme.[ch], display.[ch], item.[ch],
	  number.[ch], pixbuf_ops.[ch], skin.[ch], typedefs.h, update.[ch]:
	     New files in result of reorganization, convert to GdkPixbuf.
	* themes/nice_clocki[*]: Added transparent clock.
