README file for another_clock applet
====================================

    An analog clock applet for GNOME panel, similar to that in CDE.

    The 'change background' callbacks has been taken from gen_util/print.c
applet, by Miguel de Icaza <miguel@kernel.org>.
By the way, isn't there an easier method to put a pixmap on the panel
while mantaining the background color/pixmap under transparent pixels?

    Now, another_clock applet has a new background pixmap, courtesy of
Frank de Lange <frank.de.lange@inet.kpn.com>. So, thanks to him ;-)
