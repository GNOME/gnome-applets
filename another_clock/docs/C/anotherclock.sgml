   <title>Another Clock</title>
   <para>
     The <application>Another Clock</application> applet is an analogue
     clock similar to that in the CDE (Common Desktop Environment, an
     earlier UNIX desktop environment) panel. In its default state it is a 
     small analogue clockface with no background around it. It was part of
     the gnome-core package up to October GNOME (gnome-core-1.0.53). It
     is now distributed in gnome-applets. This guide describes the version 
     distributed in gnome-applets-1.1.2.

      You don't need to do anything special to this clock. It will just
      sit on your panel and tell the time for you. Various options are
      available with the mouse:

        You can't change the time through the clock properties. This
        is not really a bug; it's because you must be root to alter 
        the time for the whole of the system, using the <command>
        date</command> command.

     <listitem>
      <para>
        If you adjust the system clock backwards using the <command>
        date</command> command, the clock will stop working until the
        system time reaches the time the clock displays. It will start
        working normally then.
