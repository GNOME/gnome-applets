Current:

- Bug hunting...
- Async network I/O.
- Detect modem connection/disconnection (still need to find a decent way to
  do this -- ideas? ;-)

Future / Suggestions:

- Add capability to display the weather at more than one locations at
  the same time, by allowing multiple applets to run, without messing each
  other's configs.
- Add plots and history information.
- More/better icons (also, theme-friendly icons, ie. transparent background).
