Current:

- The width isn't quite right for the font of the text.

- ATS: I removed this code from gweather_update... seems to be used to
  switch the display, probably when prefs changed but we're not
  autoupdate?  Put it somewhere else.
 
    } else {
        if (gweather_info) {
            if (gweather_pref.use_metric)
                weather_info_to_metric(gweather_info);
            else
		  weather_info_to_imperial(gweather_info);
	}
        update_finish(gweather_info);
    }

- Bug hunting...
- Code reorganization... at least break up weather.[ch] and gweather-dialog.[ch]
  according to "views" (or aspects) of the weather (ie. conditions, textual
  forecast, graphical forecast, radar map, etc).  Do some things more
  properly (eg. use libgnomeui stuff for properties dialog, etc).
- Detect modem connection/disconnection (still need to find a decent way to
  do this -- ideas? ;-)

Future / Suggestions:

- Parse IWIN forecasts and display them graphically as well.
- Add plots and history information.
- More/better icons.
