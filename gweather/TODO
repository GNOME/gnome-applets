Current:

- Bug hunting...
- Code reorganization... at least break up weather.[ch] and gweather-dialog.[ch]
  according to "views" (or aspects) of the weather (ie. conditions, textual
  forecast, graphical forecast, radar map, etc).  Do some things more
  properly (eg. use libgnomeui stuff for properties dialog, etc).
- Detect modem connection/disconnection (still need to find a decent way to
  do this -- ideas? ;-)

Future / Suggestions:

- Parse IWIN forecasts and display them graphically as well.
- Add plots and history information.
- More/better icons.
