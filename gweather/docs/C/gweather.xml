   <para>
    <application>GNOME Weather</application> displays the current

    Window</interface>, shown in <xref
    linkend="gweather-weather-fig"/>. This displays the current weather
    information and either a one-day or five-day forecast.

       <para>
        Update Interval &mdash; This option determines how often
        <application>GNOME Weather</application> will connect 
        to the server(s) and retrieve weather information. Current
        conditions, forecast and radar map (if enabled) will be
        downloaded

        <title>Note About Server Updates</title>
        <para>
         Note that the <guilabel>Update Interval</guilabel> only
         determines how often your computer downloads information from
         the server(s).  The update time shown in the
         <interface>Current Conditions</interface> tab (viewed by
         double-clicking on the applet) indicates when those
         measurements were  renewed on the server, rather than when
         they were last retrieved.

        <title>Disabling Automatic Updates and Using Manual Updates</title>
        <para>
         You can disable automatic updates by unchecking the
         <guilabel>Update enabled</guilabel> box.  On the other hand, you can
         also force <application>GNOME Weather</application> to
         perform an update by choosing the corresponding option in the
         popup menu.  These two options are very useful if you have an
         intermitant internet connection, such as a laptop or modem
         provides.

        Update enabled &mdash; Select this if you would like
        <application>GNOME Weather</application> to automatically
        download the latest weather information at the time interval
        specified by <guilabel>Update</guilabel>.  Deselect this if
        you would only like weather updates to be done manually, by
        right-clicking on the applet and selecting
        <guimenuitem>Update</guimenuitem>.

        The forecast retrieved when this

     Locations are organized in a three-level hierarchy.  The top
     level contains broader geographical areas, the second contains
     sub-regions of these areas and the last contains the particular

     information is organized in the US NWS (National Weather
     Service), and that is the reason that the US and Canada appear on
     the topmost level.

   <title>Frequently Asked Questions</title>

   <para>
    This is a list of frequently asked questions about
    <application>GNOME Weather</application>.  For further information
    and updates, please visit the <ulink
    url="http://gweather.dhs.org/">GNOME Weather homepage</ulink>.  If
    your question is still unresolved, you can email the author at
    <email>spapadim+gweather@cs.cmu.edu</email>.
   </para>

   <sect3 id="unnamed1">
    <title>Why does GNOME Weather freezes my Panel?</title>
    <para>
     This is due to the blocking nature of certain network operations
     and due to the way the
     <interface>Panel</interface> currently works.
    </para>
   </sect3>

   <sect3 id="unnamed2">
    <title>Why does location list appears empty?</title>

    <para>
     This is probably because the <filename>Locations</filename> file
     was not installed in the proper place.  This is usually because
     <application>GNOME Weather</application> and GNOME were not
     configured in the same way.  The file containing the locations
     must be installed in the <filename>gweather</filename>
     subdirectory, under the gnome data directory.  You can find out
     the latter with the <userinput>gnome-config --datadir</userinput>
     command.
    </para>

    <para>
     If you have compiled gnome-applets yourself, make sure that you
     have used <userinput>configure --prefix=`gnome-config --prefix`
     --sysconfdir=`gnome-config --sysconfdir`</userinput>.  Binary
     RPMs assume a that the prefix and sysconfdir are
     <filename>/usr</filename> and <filename>/etc</filename>,
     respectively.  If you have compiled GNOME yourself with different
     options, you need to download and compile gnome-applets yourself.
    </para>
   </sect3>

   <sect3 id="unnamed3">
    <title>Why does GNOME Weather display a question mark and dashes
     for current conditions?</title>

    <para>
     This will happen if <application>GNOME Weather</application>
     cannot access the NWS server for  any reason.  This may be
     because your network  connection is down, or the NWS server is
     down, or maybe the NWS server does not currently have any
     information about your location.
    </para>
   </sect3>

   <sect3 id="unnamed4">
    <title>Why does GNOME Weather say that a forecast is not
     available?</title>

    <para>
     If you have enabled detailed forecasts, then it is possible that
     one may not be available for your location.  In this case, try
     disabling detailed forecasts.
    </para>

    <para>
     Another possible reason is that the IWIN server is down and
     <application>GNOME Weather</application> cannot retrieve forecast
     information.  The problem should go away as soon as the IWIN
     server is up  again.
    </para>
   </sect3>

<!--
   <sect3>
    <title>Why is the radar map not displayed?</title>

    <para>
     The most common reason is that the webserver containing the radar
     image is down.  You may also want to use the location editor (see
     <xref linkend="location-editor"/>) to make sure that the radar
     image URL for your location is valid.
    </para>

    <para>
     Also, if the image is in an uncommon format, <application>GNOME
     Weather</application>  may not be able to display it.  Images are
     displayed using the GNOME libraries, which supports practically
     all available formats, so this problem should be very
     rare. </para>
