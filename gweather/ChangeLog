	* Makefile.am: added pixmaps directory, set up for building
	from gnome CVS

	* gweather-pref.c (load_locations): use gnome_datadir_file()
	instead of confdefs.h

------
- Fixed bug ocurring when METAR information is unavailable.
- Replaced the gnome_less widget with a gtk_text + scrollbar, because
  it did strange things, so I worked around it.
- Removed all regexps but one (got an occasional coredump when calling
  regcomp from metar_init_re that I couldn't figure out, so I worked
  around it).  The current C code isn't as comprehensive as the regexps
  were, but it should suffice (unless the METAR format contains any
  unexpected tokens).
- Fixed a bug in the UTC to localtime conversion function (near midnight,
  would get time one hour early).  There should be a much simpler and
  less stupid way to do this, though! :-)
- Changed the humidity formula.
- Fixed a bug in the IWIN parser to handle a more general form of inputs
  (the old one would fail an assertion and dump core in forecasts where
  SFPxx was not used as expected) -- now uses regexps.
- Fixed the layout for horizontal orientation (still need to take care
  of three digit temps).
