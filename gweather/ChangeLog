2006-05-29  Philip Langdale  <philipl@mail.utexas.edu>

	* gweather.h
	* gweather-applet.c: Remove dead code for managing lifetime of
	About Dialog. This is now done automatically by Gtk+.

	* gweather-applet.h: Remove declarations of non-existent functions.

2006-05-29  Philip Langdale  <philipl@mail.utexas.edu>

	This change refactors the details dialog and is the part two of the
	refactoring I promised below.

	gweather-dialog.h
	gweather-dialog.c: (everything). Make the details dialog a real GObject
	inheriting from GtkDialog. As a bonus, dead code was revealed by the
	cleanup and has been removed.

	gweather-pref.c: (*_combo_changed). Update to reflect the changed
	signature of gweather_dialog_update.

	gweather.h: Remove all details dialog widgets from struct.

	gweather-applet.c: (details_cb, update_finish). Update the instantiate
	the details dialog properly and consolidate singleton handling.

2006-02-11  Philip Langdale  <philipl@mail.utexas.edu>

	* gweather-pref.c: There's one more place where the wrong user_data was
	being passed.

2006-02-10  Davyd Madeley  <davyd@madeley.id.au>

	* gweather-pref.c: fix a bug where the wrong pointer was being passed
	  as user_data in auto_update_toggled. Should fix #330191.

2006-02-02  Claudio Saavedra  <csaavedra@alumnos.utalca.cl>

	* gweather-dialog.c: (gweather_dialog_load_geometry): Do not
	try to set window size if gconf stored values are not valid. Fixes 
	critical warning #329544.

2006-02-01  Davyd Madeley  <davyd@madeley.id.au>

	* gweather-applet.c: don't call gtk_main_quit on destroy, this would
	  seem to be a regression from:
	      2002-05-20  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

2006-01-30  Davyd Madeley  <davyd@madeley.id.au>

	* gweather-applet.c: Remove FIXME's from libnotify code. Move
	  libnotify preference into the same location as the other preferences
	  for the applet.
	* gweather.schemas.in: add a schema for the notification preference

2006-01-22  Philip Langdale  <philipl@mail.utexas.edu>

	This change is the first part of cleaning up the
	tangled gweather applet code. One of the main goals
	is to reorganise the code associated with each main
	widget (applet, details, prefs) into proper GObjects.
	This particular change handles the Prefs Dialog.

	* gweather-xml.c
	* gweather-xml.h: Move TreeModel column definitions
	here from GWeatherPref. Although it would be overkill
	to do so, we think of the Locations tree model as being
	a subclass with specific columns.

	* gweather-pref.h
	* gweather-pref.c: (everything). Make the prefs dialog
	a real GObject inheriting from GtkDialog. We now enforce
	a proper interface and fully encapsulate the dialog's
	implementation.

	* gweather.h: Remove all pref widgets from struct.

	* gweather-applet.c: (pref_cb): Move singleton
	handling here and instantiate the prefs dialog properly.

2006-01-21  Vincent Untz  <vuntz@gnome.org>

	* gweather-applet.h:
	* gweather-pref.c: (auto_update_toggled):
	* gweather.h:  Use a separate timer to drive icon transitions.
	Closes bug #310807.

2006-01-10  Kjartan Maraas  <kmaraas@gnome.org>

	* main.c: (gweather_applet_new): Plug a small leak.

2006-01-08  Kjartan Maraas  <kmaraas@gnome.org>

	  API.  Patch from Michael Vogt <mvogt@acm.org> closes bug #325541.

	* battstat_applet.c (change_background_cb, gweather_applet_create):
	  Remove the old change_background_cb function using the new
	  functionality in libpanel-applet instead.

	  by setting the Zero Milestone for Washington, updating info between
	  the two copies of Dulles and adding Arlington, VA.  These fixes
	  should close bug #313102 and bug #310739.

2005-11-30  Philip Langdale  <philipl@mail.utexas.edu>

	Refactoring to use libgweather and libgweatherprefs.

	* es: Added Spanish doc translation.

2005-07-20  Davyd Madeley  <davyd@madeley.id.au>

	* docs/Makefile.am:
	* docs/gweather.omf.in: gnome-doc-util-ise

	* docs/*: Remove lots of unwanted files. XML files still need
	          converting to po files.

2005-07-14  Ryan Lortie  <desrt@desrt.ca>

	* gweather-xml.c: xmlChar is 'unsigned char' whereas everything else
	  is 'char'.  This causes GCC 4 to complain that pointer targets
	  differ in signedness.  To combat this, never use xmlChar * for
	  local variables and explicitly cast all strings going in and out
	  of libxml to (xmlChar *) and (char *) respectively.

2005-07-11  Davyd Madeley  <davyd@madeley.id.au>

	  mnemonics for labels and button. Make button show a more clear icon
	  and label.

2005-07-06  Davyd Madeley  <davyd@madeley.id.au>

	* weather-metar.c: Parse METAR string time with localtime_r, not
	  gmtime_r. This sets tm.tm_gmtoff to the local timezone offset
	  (rather then 0). This never used to be broken, and smells of a libc6
	  change.

2005-07-04  Rodrigo Moya <rodrigo@novell.com>

	* gweather-applet.c (update_finish): when libnotify is available,
	display a nice notification about the new forecast.

2005-04-03  Ryan Lortie  <desrt@desrt.ca>

	* gweather-pref.c: Since the current_location structure is free'd
	by the row_changed callback and since we change the active row
	while populating the TreeView in the XML parser, make a copy.

	* gweather-xml.c: Replace a direct "return -1" with "goto error_out"
	to ensure that things get free'd up in the error case.

	Both of the above are fixes to problems spotted by Kjartan.

	trans/untrans_name.

	* weather-iwin.c: Small change to deal with the removal of the

	Fix translatability of locations which has been broken for a while.
	Don't use gnome_i18n_get_language_list anymore (bug #170196).

	* gweather-pref.c: Fix the check to ensure that spurious gconf
	updates are not performed to consider the 'use_default' flags

2004-05-27  Dennis Smit  <ds@nerds-incorporated.org>

	* gweather-applet.c, weather.c: Applied patch by Gareth Owen that fixes bug
	#134018. 

	I've done two things in this patch.  Firstly, when the location is changed any
	outstanding VFS async calls are cancelled.  Secondly, instead of passing a
	pointer to the weather info structure (which is free'd when you change
	location) to the callbacks, a pointer to the GWeatherApplet structure
	is now used.  Since the applet is only free'd when the instance is removed
	from the panel, it can't get deleted before the callback is called.

	Portland and Eugene (Oregon) and a patch for temperature rounding.
	
2001-05-15  Jason Leach  <jasonleach@usa.net>

	* gweather-pref.c: Made some tiny code changes that would make the
	"Update Interval" spinner be in minutes.  Who wants to set the
	interval as seconds between 30s and 7200s?  Seems better to ask
	the user if they'd like weather updates every 2 minutes, or maybe
	every 5 or 10.

	* gweather-pref.c (gweather_pref_create): Other semi-major
	cosmetic changes to the preferences->General tab.

2001-04-18  Jason Leach  <jasonleach@usa.net>

	* gweather-pref.c (update_pref): Only bug the user about an
	invalid proxy URL when they've actually toggled the proxy to be
	used.
	(gweather_pref_run): Fix bug #53254 (and clean up some code in the
	process): Pesky error dialog that wouldn't close properly.

2001-02-20  Nat Friedman  <nat@ximian.com>

	* gweather-pref.c: Define RADARMAP by default.
	(gweather_pref_create): Rearranged the pages so that Location is
	first.  Renamed "Basic" to "General".
	(gweather_pref_load): Enable the radar maps by default.

	* gweather-applet.c (clicked_cb): Single left click brings up the
	preferences.
	(forecast_cb): New function to bring up the detailed-forecast
	dialog when the user selects the appropriate context menu item.
	(gweather_applet_create): Added the detailed-forecast menu item.
	(gweather_applet_create): Removed the shadow.

2001-02-11  Jason Leach  <jasonleach@usa.net>

	* gweather-pref.c (gweather_pref_create): Make the Properties
	dialog resizable.

2001-01-25  Alan Shutko  <ats@acm.org>

	* weather.c (iwin_parse): Strip CR from CRLF input.

	* gweather-applet.c (gweather_update): Removed check for
	update_enabled.  This was preventing updates from happening when
	you ask for them by menu.

2000-12-08  Jason Leach  <jasonleach@usa.net>

	* gweather-pref.c (gweather_pref_create): Changed window title for
	the properties dialog to "GNOME Weather Properties" from "Gweather
	Properties".

2000-12-07  Jason Leach  <jasonleach@usa.net>

	* gweather-dialog.c (gweather_dialog_create): Made the forecast
	page scrollable via mousewheel.

	* gweather-pref.c (gweather_pref_create): Made the Location CList
	scrollable via mousewheel.

Tue Nov 28 20:11:22 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gweather-applet.c, weather.[ch], Makefile.am:  Fixes, use of
	  snprintf, bound checking in bunch of places, get rid of usage
	  of g_return_if_fail for error checking, and port to gdk-pixbuf
	  from imlib.

Sat Nov 25 13:10:14 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gweather-applet.c, weather.c:  A couple of potential crash fixes
	  and cleanups

2000-11-06  Jason Leach  <leach@wam.umd.edu>

	* Locations (name): Fixed a typo of "Stockholm (Arianda)" which
	should be "Stockholm (Arlanda)".  Fixed bug #30370.

2000-06-01  Jason Leach  <leach@wam.umd.edu>

	* weather.c: replaced 5 bzero() calls with equivalent memset()
	calls, see man 3 bzero, "this function is deprecated, use memset
	in new programs", the reason appers to be mainly a portability
	thing.
	
	* weather.c (_weather_info_get_pixmap): There was no case for
	QUALIFIER_VICINITY, which is a valid possability for this switch,
	which meant that it sent users who have this in their weather
	report to a assert_not_reached() and then crashed; fixing bug
	#11806.

	(_weather_info_get_pixmap): Threw in a missing case for
	PHENOMENON_ICE_CRYSTALS, which is another valid possability that
	would otherwise give a user a assert_not_reached() and maybe crash.

2000-05-14  Andreas Hyden  <a.hyden@cyberpoint.se>

	* gweather.desktop: Added Swedish translation.

2000-04-27  Dan Mueth <d-mueth@uchicago.edu>

2000-04-18  Dan Mueth <d-mueth@uchicago.edu>

	* gweather-pref.c: Moved help button link to point to preferences
	section of the docs

2000-04-18  Dan Mueth <d-mueth@uchicago.edu>

	* docs/C/Makefile.am: Added figures which were left
	out before

2000-04-20  Jonathan Blandford  <jrb@redhat.com>

	* gweather-pref.c (gweather_pref_run): Add a help button.  Hook it
	up.  My god, this code is crufty.  I mean really crufty.  I
	cleaned up a few things but quickly got scared...

2000-04-18  Dan Mueth <d-mueth@uchicago.edu>

	* docs/C/*: Added screenshots.  Moved to new templates.  Various
	small changes in documentation including improved markup.
	* gweather-applet.c: Fixed link from Help menuitem to docs.

2000-04-04  Jacob Berkman  <jacob@helixcode.com>

	* gweather-applet.c (gweather_applet_create): reorder menu items

Sun Apr 02 17:33:11 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Locations: MT was left out of the states list for US, while MO was
	  there twice.  Patch from: Rusty Conover <rconover@zootweb.com>

2000-03-16  Jacob Berkman  <jacob@helixcode.com>

	* gweather-applet.c (place_widgets): show the temperature on small
	panels

2000-03-15  Jason Leach  <leach@wam.umd.edu>

	* gweather-applet.c (gweather_applet_create): reorganized right
	click applet menu with About on top and Properties at the bottom

	* gweather-pref.c (gweather_pref_create): changed the window title
	for the properties dialog to "Gweather Properties" from just
	"Properties"

2000-03-14  Spiros Papadimitirou <spapadim+@cs.cmu.edu>

	* Included a small patch from Jacob Berkman (jacob@helixcode.com); shows
      location name in tooltip -- useful if running multiple instances).

2000-02-29  Jacob Berkman  <jacob@helixcode.com>

	* gweather-applet.c (gweather_applet_create): rearrange the menus
	and give help an icon

2000-02-23  Peter Hawkins  <peterhawkins@ozemail.com.au>

	* gweather-about.c: stopped about box from being shown multiple times at pnce.
 
2000-02-11  Jason Leach  <leach@wam.umd.edu>

	* weather.c (_weather_info_get_pixmap): fix bug #4746

2000-02-07  Spiros Papadimitriou  <spapadim+@cs.cmu.edu>

	* Locations: Added Russia (from Serge Matveev).
    * Fixed an error with pixel size stuff (if not present,
      compilation would fail).

2000-02-03  Jason Leach  <leach@wam.umd.edu>

	* Locations (name): kill bug #5711: added radar location for
	Rochester, MN.

Sun Jan 30 01:18:01 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* The applet was starting at a set size, querying the weather
	server, *then* setting its size appropriately. On my slow modem,
	that meant it sat for 10 seconds before resizing to fit the panel
	size. Added a size/orientation check on startup to fix this.

Sat Jan 29 17:43:28 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* On an anti-warning hunt using CFLAGS="-O6 -g -W -Wall
        -Wmissing-prototypes -Wmissing-declarations". Don't mind me.

Sun Oct 31 16:45:31 1999  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* gweather-applet.c: use pixel size stuff

1999-08-15  Jacob Berkman  <jberkman@andrew.cmu.edu>

	* gweather.desktop (Icon): Use our icon

	* pixmaps/Makefile.am (gweather_iconsdir): install an
	icon for us

1999-08-12  Kjartan Maraas  <kmaraas@online.no>

	* gweather.c: fixed a typo.
	
1999-08-01  Jacob Berkman  <jberkman@andrew.cmu.edu>

	* gweather-applet.c (gweather_applet_create): use
	the stock refresh image on the 'update' menu

1999-07-30  Spiros Papadimitriou <spapadim+@cs.cmu.edu>

    * Each applet now properly saves its configuration, so
      multiple applets displaying the weather at different
      locations can run without interfering with each other.
    * Changed upper limit of update interval to 2hrs.

1999-07-28  Spiros Papadimitriou <spapadim+@cs.cmu.edu>

    * More radar locations into Locations file (now using
      weather.com instead of wx.com; awaiting official response
      from weather.com for using their service on the web).
    * Improved (or at least changed ;) hunderstorm icon.

1999-07-25  Spiros Papadimitriou <spapadim+@cs.cmu.edu>

    * Use Gtk idle timeouts to process HTTP requests in the
      background, so the interface does not freeze during updates.
    * Made the background transparent on most icons.

1999-07-18  Jacob Berkman  <jberkman@andrew.cmu.edu>

	* gweather-applet.c (gweather_applet_create): don't use
	PACKAGE here, use "gweather" instead, so we don't get
	~/.gnome/gnome-applets as a config file

1999-07-18 Spiros Papadimitriou <spapadim+@cs.cmu.edu>

    * Sync gnome CVS version with my tree.


1999-07-18  Jacob Berkman  <jberkman@andrew.cmu.edu>

	* Makefile.am: added pixmaps directory, set up for building
	from gnome CVS

	* gweather-pref.c (load_locations): use gnome_datadir_file()
	instead of confdefs.h


1999-07-15 Spiros Papadimitriou <spapadim+@cs.cmu.edu>

    * Display of radar maps is now a runtime option (now
      compile-time) and windows are destoyed when not displayed,
      to free up X resources...
    * Properly respond to "change_size" and "save_session" applet
      signals.
    * Added proxy option.


1999-07-13 Spiros Papadimitriou <spapadim+@cs.cmu.edu>

    * Better support for users with a dialup connection.


1999-07-11 Spiros Papadimitriou <spapadim+@cs.cmu.edu>

    * Fixed a stupid, but serious bug, that would cause coredumps
      upon updates...
    * Added option for detailed zone forecasts, instead of the more
      general state forecasts (takes more time to update, though,
      since the zone forecast file is about 10-20 times that of the
      state forecast file).  

1999-07-07 Spiros Papadimitriou <spapadim+@cs.cmu.edu>

    * Fixed bug ocurring when METAR information is unavailable.
    * Replaced the gnome_less widget with a gtk_text + scrollbar,
      because it did strange things, so I worked around it.
    * Removed all regexps but one (got an occasional coredump when
      calling regcomp from metar_init_re that I couldn't figure out,
      so I worked around it).  The current C code isn't as comprehensive
      as the regexps were, but it should suffice (unless the METAR
      format contains any unexpected tokens).
    * Fixed a bug in the UTC to localtime conversion function (near
      midnight, would get time one hour early).  There should be a
      much simpler and less stupid way to do this, though! :-)
    * Changed the humidity formula.
    * Fixed a bug in the IWIN parser to handle a more general form of
      inputs (the old one would fail an assertion and dump core in
      forecasts where SFPxx was not used as expected) -- now uses regexps.
    * Fixed the layout for horizontal orientation (still need to take
      care of three digit temps).

1999-07-07 Spiros Papadimitriou <spapadim+@cs.cmu.edu>

    * Began ChangeLog
