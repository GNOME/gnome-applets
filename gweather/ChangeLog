	* gweather-applet.h: Remove declarations of non-existent functions.

2006-05-29  Philip Langdale  <philipl@mail.utexas.edu>

	This change refactors the details dialog and is the part two of the
	refactoring I promised below.

	gweather-dialog.h
	gweather-dialog.c: (everything). Make the details dialog a real GObject
	inheriting from GtkDialog. As a bonus, dead code was revealed by the
	cleanup and has been removed.

	gweather-pref.c: (*_combo_changed). Update to reflect the changed
	signature of gweather_dialog_update.

	gweather.h: Remove all details dialog widgets from struct.

	gweather-applet.c: (details_cb, update_finish). Update the instantiate
	the details dialog properly and consolidate singleton handling.

2006-01-30  Davyd Madeley  <davyd@madeley.id.au>

	* gweather-applet.c: Remove FIXME's from libnotify code. Move
	  libnotify preference into the same location as the other preferences
	  for the applet.
	* gweather.schemas.in: add a schema for the notification preference

2006-01-22  Philip Langdale  <philipl@mail.utexas.edu>

	This change is the first part of cleaning up the
	tangled gweather applet code. One of the main goals
	is to reorganise the code associated with each main
	widget (applet, details, prefs) into proper GObjects.
	This particular change handles the Prefs Dialog.

	* gweather-xml.c
	* gweather-xml.h: Move TreeModel column definitions
	here from GWeatherPref. Although it would be overkill
	to do so, we think of the Locations tree model as being
	a subclass with specific columns.

	* gweather-pref.h
	* gweather-pref.c: (everything). Make the prefs dialog
	a real GObject inheriting from GtkDialog. We now enforce
	a proper interface and fully encapsulate the dialog's
	implementation.

	* gweather.h: Remove all pref widgets from struct.

	* gweather-applet.c: (pref_cb): Move singleton
	handling here and instantiate the prefs dialog properly.

2005-08-08  Davyd Madeley  <davyd@madeley.id.au>

	* weather.c: Use escaped characters for degree symbol and give
	  explanation to the translators. Closes #150926. Patch from Michael
	  Terry <mike@mterry.name>.

2005-07-30  Francisco Javier F. Serrador  <serrador@cvs.gnome.org>

	* es: Added Spanish doc translation.

2005-07-20  Davyd Madeley  <davyd@madeley.id.au>

	* docs/Makefile.am:
	* docs/gweather.omf.in: gnome-doc-util-ise

	* docs/*: Remove lots of unwanted files. XML files still need
	          converting to po files.

2005-07-14  Ryan Lortie  <desrt@desrt.ca>

	* gweather-xml.c: xmlChar is 'unsigned char' whereas everything else
	  is 'char'.  This causes GCC 4 to complain that pointer targets
	  differ in signedness.  To combat this, never use xmlChar * for
	  local variables and explicitly cast all strings going in and out
	  of libxml to (xmlChar *) and (char *) respectively.

2005-07-11  Davyd Madeley  <davyd@madeley.id.au>

2005-07-06  Davyd Madeley  <davyd@madeley.id.au>

	* weather-metar.c: Parse METAR string time with localtime_r, not
	  gmtime_r. This sets tm.tm_gmtoff to the local timezone offset
	  (rather then 0). This never used to be broken, and smells of a libc6
	  change.

2005-07-04  Rodrigo Moya <rodrigo@novell.com>

	* gweather-applet.c (update_finish): when libnotify is available,
	display a nice notification about the new forecast.

2005-04-03  Ryan Lortie  <desrt@desrt.ca>

	* gweather-pref.c: Since the current_location structure is free'd
	by the row_changed callback and since we change the active row
	while populating the TreeView in the XML parser, make a copy.

	* gweather-applet.c, weather.c: Applied patch by Gareth Owen that fixes bug
	#134018. 

	I've done two things in this patch.  Firstly, when the location is changed any
	outstanding VFS async calls are cancelled.  Secondly, instead of passing a
	pointer to the weather info structure (which is free'd when you change
	location) to the callbacks, a pointer to the GWeatherApplet structure
	is now used.  Since the applet is only free'd when the instance is removed
	from the panel, it can't get deleted before the callback is called.

	* gweather-pref.c: Made some tiny code changes that would make the
	"Update Interval" spinner be in minutes.  Who wants to set the

	every 5 or 10.

	* gweather-pref.c (gweather_pref_create): Other semi-major
	cosmetic changes to the preferences->General tab.

2001-04-18  Jason Leach  <jasonleach@usa.net>

	* weather.c: replaced 5 bzero() calls with equivalent memset()
	calls, see man 3 bzero, "this function is deprecated, use memset

	thing.
	
	* weather.c (_weather_info_get_pixmap): There was no case for
	QUALIFIER_VICINITY, which is a valid possability for this switch,
	which meant that it sent users who have this in their weather
	report to a assert_not_reached() and then crashed; fixing bug
	#11806.

	(_weather_info_get_pixmap): Threw in a missing case for
	PHENOMENON_ICE_CRYSTALS, which is another valid possability that
	would otherwise give a user a assert_not_reached() and maybe crash.

	* Locations (name): kill bug #5711: added radar location for
	Rochester, MN.

	* The applet was starting at a set size, querying the weather
	server, *then* setting its size appropriately. On my slow modem,
	that meant it sat for 10 seconds before resizing to fit the panel
	size. Added a size/orientation check on startup to fix this.

	* On an anti-warning hunt using CFLAGS="-O6 -g -W -Wall
        -Wmissing-prototypes -Wmissing-declarations". Don't mind me.

Sun Oct 31 16:45:31 1999  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* gweather-applet.c: use pixel size stuff

1999-08-15  Jacob Berkman  <jberkman@andrew.cmu.edu>

	* gweather.desktop (Icon): Use our icon

	* pixmaps/Makefile.am (gweather_iconsdir): install an
	icon for us

1999-08-12  Kjartan Maraas  <kmaraas@online.no>

	* gweather.c: fixed a typo.
	
1999-08-01  Jacob Berkman  <jberkman@andrew.cmu.edu>

	* gweather-applet.c (gweather_applet_create): use
	the stock refresh image on the 'update' menu

1999-07-30  Spiros Papadimitriou <spapadim+@cs.cmu.edu>

    * Each applet now properly saves its configuration, so
      multiple applets displaying the weather at different
      locations can run without interfering with each other.
    * Changed upper limit of update interval to 2hrs.

1999-07-28  Spiros Papadimitriou <spapadim+@cs.cmu.edu>

    * More radar locations into Locations file (now using
      weather.com instead of wx.com; awaiting official response
      from weather.com for using their service on the web).
    * Improved (or at least changed ;) hunderstorm icon.

1999-07-25  Spiros Papadimitriou <spapadim+@cs.cmu.edu>

    * Use Gtk idle timeouts to process HTTP requests in the
      background, so the interface does not freeze during updates.
    * Made the background transparent on most icons.

1999-07-18  Jacob Berkman  <jberkman@andrew.cmu.edu>

	* gweather-applet.c (gweather_applet_create): don't use
	PACKAGE here, use "gweather" instead, so we don't get
	~/.gnome/gnome-applets as a config file

1999-07-18 Spiros Papadimitriou <spapadim+@cs.cmu.edu>

    * Sync gnome CVS version with my tree.


1999-07-18  Jacob Berkman  <jberkman@andrew.cmu.edu>

	* Makefile.am: added pixmaps directory, set up for building
	from gnome CVS

	* gweather-pref.c (load_locations): use gnome_datadir_file()
	instead of confdefs.h


1999-07-15 Spiros Papadimitriou <spapadim+@cs.cmu.edu>

    * Display of radar maps is now a runtime option (now
      compile-time) and windows are destoyed when not displayed,
      to free up X resources...
    * Properly respond to "change_size" and "save_session" applet
      signals.
    * Added proxy option.


1999-07-13 Spiros Papadimitriou <spapadim+@cs.cmu.edu>

    * Better support for users with a dialup connection.


1999-07-11 Spiros Papadimitriou <spapadim+@cs.cmu.edu>

    * Fixed a stupid, but serious bug, that would cause coredumps
      upon updates...
    * Added option for detailed zone forecasts, instead of the more
      general state forecasts (takes more time to update, though,
      since the zone forecast file is about 10-20 times that of the
      state forecast file).  

1999-07-07 Spiros Papadimitriou <spapadim+@cs.cmu.edu>

    * Fixed bug ocurring when METAR information is unavailable.
    * Replaced the gnome_less widget with a gtk_text + scrollbar,
      because it did strange things, so I worked around it.
    * Removed all regexps but one (got an occasional coredump when
      calling regcomp from metar_init_re that I couldn't figure out,
      so I worked around it).  The current C code isn't as comprehensive
      as the regexps were, but it should suffice (unless the METAR
      format contains any unexpected tokens).
    * Fixed a bug in the UTC to localtime conversion function (near
      midnight, would get time one hour early).  There should be a
      much simpler and less stupid way to do this, though! :-)
    * Changed the humidity formula.
    * Fixed a bug in the IWIN parser to handle a more general form of
      inputs (the old one would fail an assertion and dump core in
      forecasts where SFPxx was not used as expected) -- now uses regexps.
    * Fixed the layout for horizontal orientation (still need to take
      care of three digit temps).

1999-07-07 Spiros Papadimitriou <spapadim+@cs.cmu.edu>

    * Began ChangeLog
