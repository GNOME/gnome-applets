	* gweather-pref.c (gweather_pref_create): Make the Properties
	dialog resizable.

2001-01-25  Alan Shutko  <ats@acm.org>

	* weather.c (iwin_parse): Strip CR from CRLF input.

	* gweather-applet.c (gweather_update): Removed check for
	update_enabled.  This was preventing updates from happening when
	you ask for them by menu.

2000-12-08  Jason Leach  <jasonleach@usa.net>

	* gweather-pref.c (gweather_pref_create): Changed window title for
	the properties dialog to "GNOME Weather Properties" from "Gweather
	Properties".

2000-12-07  Jason Leach  <jasonleach@usa.net>

	* gweather-dialog.c (gweather_dialog_create): Made the forecast
	page scrollable via mousewheel.

	* gweather-pref.c (gweather_pref_create): Made the Location CList
	scrollable via mousewheel.

Tue Nov 28 20:11:22 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gweather-applet.c, weather.[ch], Makefile.am:  Fixes, use of
	  snprintf, bound checking in bunch of places, get rid of usage
	  of g_return_if_fail for error checking, and port to gdk-pixbuf
	  from imlib.

Sat Nov 25 13:10:14 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gweather-applet.c, weather.c:  A couple of potential crash fixes
	  and cleanups

2000-11-06  Jason Leach  <leach@wam.umd.edu>

	* Locations (name): Fixed a typo of "Stockholm (Arianda)" which
	should be "Stockholm (Arlanda)".  Fixed bug #30370.

2000-06-01  Jason Leach  <leach@wam.umd.edu>

	* weather.c: replaced 5 bzero() calls with equivalent memset()
	calls, see man 3 bzero, "this function is deprecated, use memset
	in new programs", the reason appers to be mainly a portability
	thing.
	
	* weather.c (_weather_info_get_pixmap): There was no case for
	QUALIFIER_VICINITY, which is a valid possability for this switch,
	which meant that it sent users who have this in their weather
	report to a assert_not_reached() and then crashed; fixing bug
	#11806.

	(_weather_info_get_pixmap): Threw in a missing case for
	PHENOMENON_ICE_CRYSTALS, which is another valid possability that
	would otherwise give a user a assert_not_reached() and maybe crash.

2000-05-14  Andreas Hyden  <a.hyden@cyberpoint.se>

	* gweather.desktop: Added Swedish translation.

2000-04-27  Dan Mueth <d-mueth@uchicago.edu>

	* docs/C/*sgml: Added corrections suggested by Spiros and
	a couple other small fixes.
	* docs/C/*png: Updated/cleaned up a couple screenshots.

2000-04-25  Fatih Demir	<kabalak@gmx.net>
	
	* gweather.desktop : Added [tr] section .

2000-04-18  Dan Mueth <d-mueth@uchicago.edu>

	* gweather-pref.c: Moved help button link to point to preferences
	section of the docs

2000-04-18  Dan Mueth <d-mueth@uchicago.edu>

	* docs/C/Makefile.am: Added figures which were left
	out before

2000-04-20  Jonathan Blandford  <jrb@redhat.com>

	* gweather-pref.c (gweather_pref_run): Add a help button.  Hook it
	up.  My god, this code is crufty.  I mean really crufty.  I
	cleaned up a few things but quickly got scared...

2000-04-18  Dan Mueth <d-mueth@uchicago.edu>

	* docs/C/*: Added screenshots.  Moved to new templates.  Various
	small changes in documentation including improved markup.
	* gweather-applet.c: Fixed link from Help menuitem to docs.

2000-04-04  Jacob Berkman  <jacob@helixcode.com>

	* gweather-applet.c (gweather_applet_create): reorder menu items

Sun Apr 02 17:33:11 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Locations: MT was left out of the states list for US, while MO was
	  there twice.  Patch from: Rusty Conover <rconover@zootweb.com>

2000-03-16  Jacob Berkman  <jacob@helixcode.com>

	* gweather-applet.c (place_widgets): show the temperature on small
	panels

2000-03-15  Jason Leach  <leach@wam.umd.edu>

	* gweather-applet.c (gweather_applet_create): reorganized right
	click applet menu with About on top and Properties at the bottom

	* gweather-pref.c (gweather_pref_create): changed the window title
	for the properties dialog to "Gweather Properties" from just
	"Properties"

2000-03-14  Spiros Papadimitirou <spapadim+@cs.cmu.edu>

	* Included a small patch from Jacob Berkman (jacob@helixcode.com); shows
      location name in tooltip -- useful if running multiple instances).

2000-02-29  Jacob Berkman  <jacob@helixcode.com>

	* gweather-applet.c (gweather_applet_create): rearrange the menus
	and give help an icon

2000-02-23  Peter Hawkins  <peterhawkins@ozemail.com.au>

	* gweather-about.c: stopped about box from being shown multiple times at pnce.
 
2000-02-11  Jason Leach  <leach@wam.umd.edu>

	* weather.c (_weather_info_get_pixmap): fix bug #4746

2000-02-07  Spiros Papadimitriou  <spapadim+@cs.cmu.edu>

	* Locations: Added Russia (from Serge Matveev).
    * Fixed an error with pixel size stuff (if not present,
      compilation would fail).

2000-02-03  Jason Leach  <leach@wam.umd.edu>

	* Locations (name): kill bug #5711: added radar location for
	Rochester, MN.

Sun Jan 30 01:18:01 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* The applet was starting at a set size, querying the weather
	server, *then* setting its size appropriately. On my slow modem,
	that meant it sat for 10 seconds before resizing to fit the panel
	size. Added a size/orientation check on startup to fix this.

Sat Jan 29 17:43:28 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* On an anti-warning hunt using CFLAGS="-O6 -g -W -Wall
        -Wmissing-prototypes -Wmissing-declarations". Don't mind me.

Sun Oct 31 16:45:31 1999  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* gweather-applet.c: use pixel size stuff

1999-08-15  Jacob Berkman  <jberkman@andrew.cmu.edu>

	* gweather.desktop (Icon): Use our icon

	* pixmaps/Makefile.am (gweather_iconsdir): install an
	icon for us

1999-08-12  Kjartan Maraas  <kmaraas@online.no>

	* gweather.c: fixed a typo.
	
1999-08-01  Jacob Berkman  <jberkman@andrew.cmu.edu>

	* gweather-applet.c (gweather_applet_create): use
	the stock refresh image on the 'update' menu

1999-07-30  Spiros Papadimitriou <spapadim+@cs.cmu.edu>

    * Each applet now properly saves its configuration, so
      multiple applets displaying the weather at different
      locations can run without interfering with each other.
    * Changed upper limit of update interval to 2hrs.

1999-07-28  Spiros Papadimitriou <spapadim+@cs.cmu.edu>

    * More radar locations into Locations file (now using
      weather.com instead of wx.com; awaiting official response
      from weather.com for using their service on the web).
    * Improved (or at least changed ;) hunderstorm icon.

1999-07-25  Spiros Papadimitriou <spapadim+@cs.cmu.edu>

    * Use Gtk idle timeouts to process HTTP requests in the
      background, so the interface does not freeze during updates.
    * Made the background transparent on most icons.

1999-07-18  Jacob Berkman  <jberkman@andrew.cmu.edu>

	* gweather-applet.c (gweather_applet_create): don't use
	PACKAGE here, use "gweather" instead, so we don't get
	~/.gnome/gnome-applets as a config file

1999-07-18 Spiros Papadimitriou <spapadim+@cs.cmu.edu>

    * Sync gnome CVS version with my tree.


1999-07-18  Jacob Berkman  <jberkman@andrew.cmu.edu>

	* Makefile.am: added pixmaps directory, set up for building
	from gnome CVS

	* gweather-pref.c (load_locations): use gnome_datadir_file()
	instead of confdefs.h


1999-07-15 Spiros Papadimitriou <spapadim+@cs.cmu.edu>

    * Display of radar maps is now a runtime option (now
      compile-time) and windows are destoyed when not displayed,
      to free up X resources...
    * Properly respond to "change_size" and "save_session" applet
      signals.
    * Added proxy option.


1999-07-13 Spiros Papadimitriou <spapadim+@cs.cmu.edu>

    * Better support for users with a dialup connection.


1999-07-11 Spiros Papadimitriou <spapadim+@cs.cmu.edu>

    * Fixed a stupid, but serious bug, that would cause coredumps
      upon updates...
    * Added option for detailed zone forecasts, instead of the more
      general state forecasts (takes more time to update, though,
      since the zone forecast file is about 10-20 times that of the
      state forecast file).  

1999-07-07 Spiros Papadimitriou <spapadim+@cs.cmu.edu>

    * Fixed bug ocurring when METAR information is unavailable.
    * Replaced the gnome_less widget with a gtk_text + scrollbar,
      because it did strange things, so I worked around it.
    * Removed all regexps but one (got an occasional coredump when
      calling regcomp from metar_init_re that I couldn't figure out,
      so I worked around it).  The current C code isn't as comprehensive
      as the regexps were, but it should suffice (unless the METAR
      format contains any unexpected tokens).
    * Fixed a bug in the UTC to localtime conversion function (near
      midnight, would get time one hour early).  There should be a
      much simpler and less stupid way to do this, though! :-)
    * Changed the humidity formula.
    * Fixed a bug in the IWIN parser to handle a more general form of
      inputs (the old one would fail an assertion and dump core in
      forecasts where SFPxx was not used as expected) -- now uses regexps.
    * Fixed the layout for horizontal orientation (still need to take
      care of three digit temps).

1999-07-07 Spiros Papadimitriou <spapadim+@cs.cmu.edu>

    * Began ChangeLog
