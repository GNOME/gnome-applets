	* gweather-applet.c: use pixel size stuff

1999-08-15  Jacob Berkman  <jberkman@andrew.cmu.edu>

	* gweather.desktop (Icon): Use our icon

	* pixmaps/Makefile.am (gweather_iconsdir): install an
	icon for us

1999-08-12  Kjartan Maraas  <kmaraas@online.no>

	* gweather.c: fixed a typo.
	
1999-08-01  Jacob Berkman  <jberkman@andrew.cmu.edu>

	* gweather-applet.c (gweather_applet_create): use
	the stock refresh image on the 'update' menu

1999-07-30  Spiros Papadimitriou <spapadim+@cs.cmu.edu>

    * Each applet now properly saves its configuration, so
      multiple applets displaying the weather at different
      locations can run without interfering with each other.
    * Changed upper limit of update interval to 2hrs.

1999-07-28  Spiros Papadimitriou <spapadim+@cs.cmu.edu>

    * More radar locations into Locations file (now using
      weather.com instead of wx.com; awaiting official response
      from weather.com for using their service on the web).
    * Improved (or at least changed ;) hunderstorm icon.

1999-07-25  Spiros Papadimitriou <spapadim+@cs.cmu.edu>

    * Use Gtk idle timeouts to process HTTP requests in the
      background, so the interface does not freeze during updates.
    * Made the background transparent on most icons.

1999-07-18  Jacob Berkman  <jberkman@andrew.cmu.edu>

	* gweather-applet.c (gweather_applet_create): don't use
	PACKAGE here, use "gweather" instead, so we don't get
	~/.gnome/gnome-applets as a config file

1999-07-18 Spiros Papadimitriou <spapadim+@cs.cmu.edu>

    * Sync gnome CVS version with my tree.


1999-07-18  Jacob Berkman  <jberkman@andrew.cmu.edu>

	* Makefile.am: added pixmaps directory, set up for building
	from gnome CVS

	* gweather-pref.c (load_locations): use gnome_datadir_file()
	instead of confdefs.h


1999-07-15 Spiros Papadimitriou <spapadim+@cs.cmu.edu>

    * Display of radar maps is now a runtime option (now
      compile-time) and windows are destoyed when not displayed,
      to free up X resources...
    * Properly respond to "change_size" and "save_session" applet
      signals.
    * Added proxy option.


1999-07-13 Spiros Papadimitriou <spapadim+@cs.cmu.edu>

    * Better support for users with a dialup connection.


1999-07-11 Spiros Papadimitriou <spapadim+@cs.cmu.edu>

    * Fixed a stupid, but serious bug, that would cause coredumps
      upon updates...
    * Added option for detailed zone forecasts, instead of the more
      general state forecasts (takes more time to update, though,
      since the zone forecast file is about 10-20 times that of the
      state forecast file).  

1999-07-07 Spiros Papadimitriou <spapadim+@cs.cmu.edu>

    * Fixed bug ocurring when METAR information is unavailable.
    * Replaced the gnome_less widget with a gtk_text + scrollbar,
      because it did strange things, so I worked around it.
    * Removed all regexps but one (got an occasional coredump when
      calling regcomp from metar_init_re that I couldn't figure out,
      so I worked around it).  The current C code isn't as comprehensive
      as the regexps were, but it should suffice (unless the METAR
      format contains any unexpected tokens).
    * Fixed a bug in the UTC to localtime conversion function (near
      midnight, would get time one hour early).  There should be a
      much simpler and less stupid way to do this, though! :-)
    * Changed the humidity formula.
    * Fixed a bug in the IWIN parser to handle a more general form of
      inputs (the old one would fail an assertion and dump core in
      forecasts where SFPxx was not used as expected) -- now uses regexps.
    * Fixed the layout for horizontal orientation (still need to take
      care of three digit temps).

    * Began ChangeLog
