- Added proxy option.
- Better support for users with a dialup connection.
- Fixed a stupid, but serious bug, that would cause coredumps upon
  updates...
- Added option for detailed zone forecasts, instead of the more general
  state forecasts (takes more time to update, though, since the zone
  forecast file is about 10-20 times that of the state forecast file).
