* Turn notes into their own gtk type (seems to work for gmc's icons
  and I can't see any other difference between what I'm doing and what
  it is doing)
* DND
* Prettify notes.
* hide single notes
* remove non note-specific commands from note menu.
* think about data on note and what has to change to support images.
* work on the new format.  make it user chooseable and more smart.
