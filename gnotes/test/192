       int rename(const char *oldpath, const char *newpath);

DESCRIPTION
       rename  renames  a  file, moving it between directories if
       required.

       Any other  hard  links  to  the  file  (as  created  using
       link(2)) are unaffected.

       If  newpath  already exists it will be atomically replaced
       (subject to a few conditions - see ERRORS below), so  that
       there  is  no point at which another process attempting to
       access newpath will find it missing.

       If newpath exists but the operation fails for some  reason
       rename  guarantees  to  leave  an  instance  of newpath in
       place.

       However, when overwriting there will probably be a  window
       in  which both oldpath and newpath refer to the file being
       renamed.

       If oldpath refers to a symbolic link the link is  renamed;
       if  newpath  refers  to  a  symbolic link the link will be
       o</Data>
