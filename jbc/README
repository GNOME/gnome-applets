Jon's Binary Clock v1.3

UPDATE: This is the GNOME panel applet version. There are _many_ bugs.
        Contributions are welcome.

This is a clock which represents time in BCD.

Each digit is represented by 4-bits, top to bottom.

  hour       min       sec

This is my first C project, as well as my first X11/GTK+ project.

Please let me know if you think this is nifty, and/or if you have any
suggestions on the code.

Thanks!
