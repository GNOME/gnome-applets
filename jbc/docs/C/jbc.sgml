  <para>
    <application>Jon's Binary Clock</application> (or 
    <application>jbc_applet</application> for short) is an applet
    which shows the time in an unusual form: binary coded decimal. 
    It has twenty-four LEDs which represent the hours, minutes and
    seconds by illuminating the appropriate LED.
  </para>
  <para>
    You can start the binary clock by clicking <mousebutton>button
    3</mousebutton> on an empty part of the <interface>panel</interface>
    and following the sequence
    <menuchoice>
     <guimenu>Applets</guimenu>
     <guisubmenu>Clocks</guisubmenu>
     <guimenuitem>JCB Binary Clock</guimenuitem>
    </menuchoice>
    or you can type the following command at a command line:
    <command>jbc_applet --activate-goad-server=jbc_applet</command>

    The binary clock applet was written by Jon Anhold
    (<email>jon@snoopy.net</email>. Please report bugs in it to the
    <ulink type="http" url="http://bugs.gnome.org">GNOME bug
    tracking system</ulink>. You can do this by following the
    guidelines on that site or by using <application>bug-buddy</application>
    from the command-line. For the package, put gnome-applets.

     You don't need to do anything special to this clock. It just
     sits there and flashes lights at you. Some of the standard applet
     mouse options are available:

    <para>
      BCD stands for binary-coded decimal, a way of representing 
      normal denary (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9) numbers as what programmers
      call &quot;a set of binary numbers in four bits, thus removing the
      numbers A to F&quot;. If this doesn't make sense, just be aware
      that this clock is an amusement for programmers, and serves
      no really useful purpose!

      It helps to read this clock upside-down! Start at the bottom and 
      read up to the top.
    </para>
    <para>
      The right-hand pair of columns shows the two digits of the seconds:
      the units on the right, the tens on the left. The centre pair of
      columns shows the two digits of the minutes. The left hand pair of
      columns shows the two digits of the hours.
    </para>
    <para>
      You add up the values of the illuminated LEDs in each column.
      You should get a number between zero to nine for each. That's
      the time.

      It is probably simplest to decipher the hours and minutes
      first before trying to follow the seconds, which are always 
      changing.

        If you add it to a vertical panel, it is a nice size. If you
        then move it to a horizonal panel, it changes size in the 
        horizontal panel. If you move it back to a vertical panel, it
        doesn't change size back, and forces the panel to widen itself.
