   <title>The life applet</title>
   <para>
     The GNOME panel <application>life</application> is an applet
     which runs 'the game of life' according to Conway's rules in a
     small grid in your panel, with the organism and background colour
     constantly changing. It is part of the gnome-applets package. This 
     section of the guide refers to life-1.1.2, which is distributed in
     gnome-applets-1.1.2.

   <para>
     To add the <application>life applet</application> to your 
     <interface>panel</interface>, either click on
     <mousebutton>mouse button 2</mousebutton> on an empty part of the 
     <interface>panel</interface> and follow the sequence

     <guisubmenu>Amusements</guisubmenu>
     <guimenuitem>Game of Life</guimenuitem>

      The <application>life applet</application> was written by

    <para>
      Please report bugs in the life applet to the
      <ulink type="http" url="http://bugs.gnome.org">GNOME bug
      tracking system</ulink>. You can do this by following the
      guidelines on that site or by using
      <application>bug-buddy</application>
      from the command-line. For the package, put gnome-applets.

       Once it is present, you don't need to do anything to the life
       applet. It will run happily on its own. The following options 
       are available:

         Pressing <mousebutton>mouse button 2</mousebutton> brings
         up some of the standard choices available for applets. There is
         no <guilabel>properties menu</guilabel>, but there is an About
         box and an option to randomise the game if it is getting boring.

         Holding down <mousebutton>mouse button 3</mousebutton> allows you

     <para>
       The Game of Life as described by Conway in 1970 has the following 
       rules:
     </para>
     <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
       <para>
         Start with a grid (usually a plain square) of squares. Fill 
         a proportion of them with cells, randomly placed. This is generation
         zero.
       </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
       <para>
         Any cell with two or three neighbours survives to the next
         generation.
       </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
       <para>
         On any square with no cell and three neighbours, a new cell is
         born. On any other square, no new cells are born.
       </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
       <para>
         Repeat generations.
       </para>
      </listitem>
     </itemizedlist>

     <para>
       The game will eventually end in one of a number of ways:
     </para>

     <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
       <para>
         The death of all cells (theoretical, but uncommon in the life
         applet).
       </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
       <para>
         A fixed equilibrium with all remaining cells surviving but
         creating no new cells.
       </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
       <para>
         A dynamic equilibrium where the game cycles continually through
         a particular sequence of patterns.
       </para>
      </listitem>
     </itemizedlist>

     <para>
       For interest value, the current grid in the life applet is 78 by 78 
       and the proportion of squares filled with cells is 50%.
