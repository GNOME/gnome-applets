	* life.c: made the size be -4 of the panel size and not -2 so that
	  it no longer makes the panel too wide.  Also made it do truly
	  random numbers to make Alan happy and not file a report on BUGTRAQ
	  about the predictability of life enviroments in the life applets

	* life.c: do more random operation

	* life.c: use gdkrgb (it's faster then setting each point by normal
	  x calls), and use an rgb buffer and do some interesting things
	  to make it looks cool, however this slows it down, so I also
	  made the interval larger to consume less cpu (though it still
	  does eat up some), and also adapted to the new size stuff
