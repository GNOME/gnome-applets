	* life.c: use gdkrgb (it's faster then setting each point by normal
	  x calls), and use an rgb buffer and do some interesting things
	  to make it looks cool, however this slows it down, so I also
	  made the interval larger to consume less cpu (though it still
	  does eat up some), and also adapted to the new size stuff
