      marked for translation (mispositioned locale tag).
    * stickynotes.glade: Mark the copyright string as untranslatable, as well
      as a few other strings that are untrasnlatable.

    * Renamed a bunch of files to standardized forms:

2003-01-26  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

      compilation on gcc 2.95 (and make proper ANSI C).
    
2003-01-23  Loban A Rahman <loban@earthling.net>

    * many files: Now the default click-behaivour of the applet is
      configurable. It can either be "create a new note" or show/hide all
      sticky notes. Thanks to Mike Sowka for the patch!
    * configure.in: release 1.0.6

2003-01-16  Loban A Rahman <loban@earthling.net>

    * configure.in: More tweaking to remove deprecated/obsolete macros.

      that libglade can find the pixmaps.
    * src/stickynotes.c: Fixed some memory leaks in stickynotes_save() and
      stickynotes_load().
