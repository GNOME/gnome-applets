      as a few other strings that are untrasnlatable.

2003-01-26  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

    * src/stickynotes.c: Applied patch by Christophe Fergeau to allow
      compilation on gcc 2.95 (and make proper ANSI C).
    
2003-01-23  Loban A Rahman <loban@earthling.net>

    * many files: Now the default click-behaivour of the applet is
      configurable. It can either be "create a new note" or show/hide all
      sticky notes. Thanks to Mike Sowka for the patch!
    * configure.in: release 1.0.6

2003-01-16  Loban A Rahman <loban@earthling.net>

    * configure.in: More tweaking to remove deprecated/obsolete macros.

    * pixmaps/Makefile.am: Placed glade files and pixmaps in one location so
      that libglade can find the pixmaps.
    * src/stickynotes.c: Fixed some memory leaks in stickynotes_save() and
      stickynotes_load().
    * src/stickynotes_applet_callbacks.c, src/stickynotes_applet_callbacks.h:

    * Improved auto-saving. Now, auto saving occurs :

    * Sticky notes now prelight when on mouse and keyboard focus.

2002-12-28  Loban A Rahman <loban@earthling.net>
