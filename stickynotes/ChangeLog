	messages.

2008-09-04  Loban A Rahman <loban@earthling.net>

	* stickynotes_applet.c, stickynotes_applet_callbacks.c, Makefile.am:
	  Used the egg_* functions so that help actually gets displayed. Also
	  made it so that the prefs dialog appears in the same desktop that
	  the applet itself is in. Applied Muktha's patch to fix bug #121433,

2008-08-26  Loban A Rahman <loban@earthling.net>

	* stickynotes.glade, stickynotes.c: Added a help button to every

	  in the "Advanced Settings" portion of Breda's documentation.

	* stickynotes_applet_callbacks.c: The resize bar and window
	  decorations now appear and disapper on mouseover AND focus
	  correctly. Basically, they will always appear if it is in either
	  mouseover or focus. Fixes bug #115317.
	* stickynotes.c, stickynotes_callbacks.c: The icons now change
	  size accordingly when themes like "Large Print" are chosen. They
	  don't yet change color when "Inverse" themes are chosen, that
	  still needs to be fixed by providing alternatives.
	* stickynotes.c, stickynotes_callbacks.c: The properties dialog of
	  each note are now easier to use. Pressing enter auto closes the
	  dialog.
	
Wed Jul 02 15:43:01 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* stickynotes.glade:  Fix mnemonic conflicts for Height/Help 
	& Color/Close again!

	  bug #112606.
	* stickynotes.glade: Reworded some UI text to make it more HIG
	  compliant.
	* stickynotes.c: Changed how custom colors are applied. Now, when the
	  "color from system theme" is used, the current gtk theme is actually
	  used (didn't before). There are still a few kinks to iron out here.
	* stickynotes.c, stickynotes.h, stickynotes_applet_callbacks.c:
	  Unspegettified internal API. :-)
	* stickynotes.c: Fixed bug #113413. When changing colors, the notes
	  now fully update properly.
	* stickynotes.c, stickynotes_applet.*: Fixed bug #113414, all sticky

	* stickynotes_applet.c, stickynotes_applet_callbacks.*:
	  Fixed compile warnings,
	  Bug #112616 now fully fixed, but there seems to be a bug in the
	  listener for bonobo_ui_components. They trigger unnecessarily.
	* stickynotes.c: Changed UI slightly. Now, when a note is locked, the
	  button shows a locked picture with a "Locked Note" tooltip, rather
	  than a unlocked picture with a "Unlock Note" tooltip. And vice
	  versa.
	* TODO: Updated.
	* stickynotes.c: Fixed an infinite loop when toggling lock using menu.
	* *.h, *.c: Bug #109427 now fully done. Individual note colors are now

	  d. The preferences dialog should not have a separator to be
             consistant with all other applet preference dialogs in
             gnome-applets & gnome-panel modules.
	  This fixes bug #113468.

    * Fixed a small memory leak.

2003-01-05  Loban A Rahman <loban@earthling.net>

    * [ VERSION 0.6.1 ]
    * Sticky notes now close on button-release of the close button, rather

    * Fixed a bug in pixbuf size changing while prelighting (thanks to Mark
      Finlay for spotting this one).

    * Finished documentation.

2002-12-28  Loban A Rahman <loban@earthling.net>

      raises their windows as well. Thanks Paul Coates for the suggeston.

2002-12-27  Loban A Rahman <loban@earthling.net>

    * Removed overused PACKAGE macro in a few places.
    * Incorporated Chris Chabot's improved specfile, thanks!

    * Note sizes are now saved/loaded (previously only position was).
    * Various other cleanups.
    * Hmmm, using the functions in panel-applet-gconf.h crashes the panel.
    * WARNING: The XML file format has changed, and is thus incompatible
      with previous versions.
    * I believe it is now FEATURE COMPLETE. It must remain simple and
      not explode with features. I shall release v1.0 soon.
