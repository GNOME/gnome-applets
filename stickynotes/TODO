*** Sticky Notes for the Gnome Desktop Environment. ***

* Fix BonoboUIComponent Listener unnecessarily triggering. It triggers
  whenever one opens the applet menu, even if the state of the id
  it's listening to hasn't changed.
  	- is this a bug in bonobo?

* Use inconsistent setting on applet "Lock Notes" menu when all notes
  are not locked/unlocked
	- but how?

* Need to change color of title and buttons depending on note color.
	- worth it?

* Update documentation.
	- including more up-to-date figures.
