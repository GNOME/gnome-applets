*** Sticky Notes for the Gnome Desktop Environment. ***

* Fix BonoboUIComponent Listener unnecessarily triggering. It triggers
  whenever one opens the applet menu, even if the state of the id
  it's listening to hasn't changed.
  	- is this a bug in bonobo?

* Use inconsistent setting on applet "Lock Notes" menu when all notes
  are not locked/unlocked
	- but how?

* Customize text color? This is getting out of hand. Also, how does one
  apply a style to all widgets? Fix the minor kinks too. Might be better
  to create an RC string and parse it.

* Could I put the sticky notes stock icon registration into an RC file
  that is parsed rather than in code?

* Update documentation.
	- including more up-to-date figures.
