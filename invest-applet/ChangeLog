	* docs/C/legal.xml:
	* docs/invest-applet.omf.in:
	* docs/Makefile.am:
	* Makefile.am: Add documentation for the invest applet. Courtesy
	of Terry (see bug #504591). Updates to reflect recent UI changes
	where added by myself. Build integration done by Kjartan Maraas.

	* invest/applet.py:
	* data/art/Makefile.am:
	* data/Invest_applet.server.in.in:
	* data/art/*.png:
	* data/art/*.svg: Another update from Matteo Zandi. Move the
	indicator into the main icon. It also makes the icon naming slightly
	closer to that used for the icon themes (those aren't supported
	yet). See bug #526004.

2008-04-15  Callum McKenzie  <callum@spooky-possum.org>

	* invest/applet.py: 
	* invest/quotes.py: A patch from Matteo Zandi to restore the idea
	of a visible indicator of your stocks overall health. See bug
	#526004.

	* invest/chart.py
	* invest/preferences.py
	* invest/applet.py
	* invest/widgets.py
	* data/financialchart.ui
	* data/prefs-dialog.ui: Another big UI change from Matteo
	Zandi. Add spark-lines to the display. Change the graph url to use
	the european yahoo server since it gives better coverage (US and
	Euro). Show the headers only if there is anything in that column
	to show. Simplified the QuoteUpdater class. Path fixes in
	__init__.py.

2008-03-31  Callum McKenzie  <callum@spooky-possum.org>

	* invest/widgets.py: i18n fixes.

	* invest/applet.py
	* invset/widgets.py: Significant UI changes from Matteo
	Zandi. Clicking on the icon produces a dock window like the clock
	applet. The confusing (and not-always-working) colour-patch to
	indicate whether the stocks have gone up or down has been
	removed. Better column alignment and a monospace font. Column
	headers.

2008-03-16  Callum McKenzie  <callum@spooky-possum.org>

	* invest/applet.py: Patch from emil@nishra.com to make the
	right-click menu work for the entire applet. (Bug #522274.)

	* invest/invest-applet.py (_check): Remove glade functions that
	slipped through the patch.

2007-10-14  Callum McKenzie  <callum@spooky-possum.org>

	* invest/quotes.py (QuoteUpdater.populate): 
	* invest/preferences.py (PrefsDialog.__init__): Sort the stocks
	list so we aren't stuck with the random list given by python's
	dict iterator. As per Matt Chisholm's patch in bug #460080. Also
	removed some commented-out old versions of some code (svn is for
	storing that sort of thing).

2007-10-13  Callum McKenzie  <callum@spooky-possum.org>

	* invest/quotes.py (QuoteUpdater.populate): Avoid a division by
	zero when nothing was paid for stocks. (Bug #459116)

	* invest/about.py (show_about): Removed a dead URL from the about
	dialog. Matt Chisholm/Andrew Burton (Bug #460087).

	* invest/applet.py (ProgramWindow.__init__): Make the pop-up
	window non-resizeable at the suggestion of Matt Chisholm (Bug
	#461345). This means that the window auto-sizes and takes into
	account space left by stocks removed from the drop-down list.

2007-07-30  Claude Paroz <claude@2xlibre.net>

	* invest/about.py: Corrected utf8 to utf-8. Fixes bug #459086.

2007-07-17  Jaap Haitsma  <jaap@haitsma.org>

	nicely. (There is still a problem when mixing currencies)
