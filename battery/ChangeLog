	* battery.c: conditionally compile panel size support since
	Matt Loper <matt@helixcode.com> is too lame to run the very 
	cool HEAD panel.

	<vetteman> Dude I can run the HEAD panel
	<boc> you're not worthy

2000-02-29  Jacob Berkman  <jacob@helixcode.com>

	* battery.c: Stopped about box from being shown multiple times at once.

2000-02-11  Jason Leach  <leach@wam.umd.edu>

	* battery.c (battery_update): declare char variables as 'signed'
	because they will hold negative values and some compilers will
	puke on that, bug #2275
	* read-battery.h: same 
	* read-bettery.c (batter_read_charge): same

Sun Feb 06 12:54:51 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Makefile.am: fogot the horiz xpm in the EXTRA_DIST

Sat Feb 05 04:04:33 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* battery.[ch],properties.c,session.c: Make the applet not quit on
	  machines without APM, it just gives a dialog and shows 100%.  Also
	  twiddle with the layout to work more nicely in lower sizes, and
	  also follow panel pixel sizes
