       The applet starts with the pieces in the correct order: this is
       the order you will need to restore it to. To start it, press
       <mousebutton>mouse button 3</mousebutton> and then select
       <guimenuitem>Scramble Pieces</guimenuitem>. Move the pieces about
       with <mousebutton>mouse button 1</mousebutton> until you have
       restored them all to their original positions. When you have
       done this, you will see a "You win!" dialogue box.
