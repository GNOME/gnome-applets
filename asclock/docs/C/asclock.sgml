   <title>AfterStep Clock</title>
   <para>
     The <application>AfterStep Clock</application> is an applet which 
     displays the time in both analogue (clockface) and digital format 
     along with the day of the week and the date. It is based on the look
     of the NeXTStep clock. It is part of the gnome-core package in
     October GNOME (gnome-core-1.0.53) and part of the gnome-applets
     package in later releases. This guide is written referring to 
     to the clock distributed in gnome-applets-1.1.2.

      You don't need to do anything special to this clock. It will just
      sit on your panel and tell the time for you. Various options are
      available with the mouse:

         If no timezone is selected, the local time on the system clock
         is used as a default.

         You can't change the time through the clock properties. This
         is not really a bug; it's because you must be root to alter 
         the time for the whole of the system, using the <command>
         date</command> command.

        If you adjust the system clock backwards using the <command>
        date</command> command, the clock will stop working until the
        system time reaches the time the clock displays. It will start
        working normally then.
