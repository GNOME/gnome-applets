PRELIMINARIES
   you need xearth to see the globe in properties.
   since this is a technology preview, do not expect anything to work :)
   the applet clock works though...
 
INSTALL
change the path to the xpms in asclock.c
include applets/asclock in gnome-core/configure.in
recompile gnome-core

LANGUAGE SELECTION
copy all files of your favourite language to the directory
/usr/local/share/asclock/
They will be used instead of the builtin pixmaps.
