I have clone the repo what next:

1. Make the autogen.sh executable:
    $ chmod +x autogen.sh

2. Make sure you have the following packages installed or you will get a warning like
    ./autogen.sh: 2: autoreconf: not found
    
    * automake
    * build-essential
    * libglib2.0-dev (for AM_GLIB_GNU_GETTEXT makro)
    * libtool (for AC_PROG_LIBTOOL makro)
    * intltool (otherwise you get a syntax error in .configure)
    * gettext (pulled by intltool automatically)
    * libgtk-3-dev
    * gsettings-desktop-schemas-dev
    * libwnck-3-dev
    * libpanel-applet-4-dev

3. When you have installed all above packages, run autogen.sh
    $ ./autogen.sh

4. If there are no other errors then run
    $ ./configure
    $ make

5. You now have the window-picker-applet in src/

HOWTO START IT?
