You have cloned the repository, whats next?

1. Make sure you have the following packages installed or you will get 
   a warning like:
   ./autogen.sh: 2: autoreconf: not found
   
   On Ubuntu those would be:
    * automake
    * build-essential
    * libglib2.0-dev (for AM_GLIB_GNU_GETTEXT makro)
    * libtool (for AC_PROG_LIBTOOL makro)
    * intltool (otherwise you get a syntax error in .configure)
    * gettext (pulled by intltool automatically)
    * libgtk-3-dev
    * gsettings-desktop-schemas-dev
    * libwnck-3-dev
    * libpanel-applet-4-dev

2. When you have installed all above packages, run autogen.sh
    $ ./autogen.sh

3. If there are no other errors then run configure and make. 
   You must pass the --prefix option or the gnome-panel will not find your applet
    $ ./configure --prefix=/usr --libexecdir=/usr/lib/window-picker-applet/
    $ make #compile the window applet to src/
    $ sudo make install #installs in /usr

4. You now have the window-picker-applet installed

HOWTO START IT?

ALT+RIGHT CLICK on the gnome-panel and choose 'Add to Panel...' and then add
select the Window Picker.
