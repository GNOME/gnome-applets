Version 0.3
===========

Handles sticky windows.

Version 0.2
===========
Implemented an enlightment simulation mode

If your fvwm2rc contains the following line

fvwm-pager HeadLess 0 4

(0 and 4 are the indices of the first and last desktop respectivly)
the module is started without appearing in the panel. But, and that's
the important thing, all properties are handled in the way the
gnome-pager applets needs them. This means that you can use the
gnome-pager applet and fvwm2 together. Don't forget to mark the panel
window sticky in the fvwm2rc file.

What's more important is that the dreaded IOR and panel cookie
problems is not more relevant. Well, you loose some functionality with
the gnome-pager (you can't switch desktops using the pager window, and 
you can't drag windows around). But it looks much nicer then my user
interface. 


Version 0.1
===========
Reimplemented the pager to use a canvas instead of a drawing area.
Now it's possible to move windows around. Theoretically it should also
be possible to move the icons around, but this doesn't work now.
