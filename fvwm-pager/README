This is a rewrite of the FvwmPager Module, so that it can be used by
the panel as an applet. It uses Gtk and Gdk functions instead of the
raw Xlib functions of the original FvwmPager Module.

To install it you have to have:
1) the fvwm2 sources on your system.
2) compile fvwm2. I know this is clumsy, but as long as i don't have
   ported the fvwm2 module lib and headers files, this is the only way 
   to access them.
3) go to the root directory of the gnome-core package and call
   autogen.sh with the
   `--with-fvwm2=<directory where the fvwm2 sources are>. In my setup
   this is:
   ./autgen.sh --prefix=/usr/local/gnome-cvs --with-fvwm2=/disk/compiles/fvwm-2.0.46 --with-included-gettext --with-window-manager=fvwm2
4) after installation of the gnome-core package you can either
   a) make a symlink from the <prefix>/bin/fvwm-pager to your fvwm2
      module directory
   b) add the <prefix>/bin directory to the module path of fvwm2 in
      your fvwm2 setup file (usually ~/.fvwm2rc).
5) I made an entry in one of the fvwm2 menus i'm using to start the
   pager. I added the line
   `+          "FvwmGnome"         Module fvwm-pager 0 4'
   to give me 4 virtual desktops to my .fvwm2rc file.
6) After starting the panel, you may add the pager to the panel by
   activating this menu entry.

They look and feel is not pretty now, and you can't change the colors
or anything else, but i'm working on it. Perhaps i'll also switch to
gnome-canvas instead of the drawing area.
