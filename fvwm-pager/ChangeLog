	* Fix for build directory different from package top directory in
	Makefile.am

1998-12-08  Michael Lausch  <mla@gams.at>

	* gtkpager.c: change includes so that the local fvwm2 sources are
	used. 

	* fvwm-pager.c (substruct_notify): new function. Called whenever a 
	client message is received on the root window. 
	(root_widget_filter): new function. Filter out all events except
	ClientMessage events. Used for the root window.
	(main): create a GTK widget for the root window, which listens for 
	SubStructurNotify events. These events are used for client
	messages from gnomepager.
	(main): Change the switch_to_desktop signal handling function.
	(switch_to_desktop): Use the data parameter as an indicator if
	called from out own pager or from the gnomepager applet. If called 
	from our own pager, a client message with the current workspace is 
	sent to the root window.
	(configure_window): fix a 0 ptr reference if the WIN_STATE
	property isn't set on a window.
	(destroy_window): remove deleted windows from our hash table.
	(process_message): if desktop is switched from within fvwm2, call
	switch_to_desktop so that a client message is sent to the root
	window, to inform the rest of GNOME that the desktop has changed.

	* Makefile.am (Utilitiesdir): Add fvwm source files, so that the
	applet is now self contained.
