Sound Monitor is a GNOME panel applet, it contains modules that display
various messages to the user to alert of problems or events. It also
(optionally)logs all the events to a log file.

Current Modules include:
  - Test Module: A module to test the applet and/or use as a template.
  - Core dump catcher: Monitors a path for core dumps, when one is found the
      core is renamed with a time stamp and a gdb backtrace is logged
      or (optionally) displayed.
  - Load average monitor: (optionally) Displays warning messages when the
      system load average rises above a user defined threshhold.
  - File Tailer: Can print additions to a file similar to 'tail -f'

Requirements:
  - GNOME version 1.0.1 or higher. (http://www.gnome.org)

  Module requirements (needed to run properly, but not compile):

    - Core dump catcher:       gdb
    - Load average monitor:    uptime

Notes for this release:
  0.2.1 contains these changes over 0.2.0:
  > Display code largely re-written, it no longer scrolls the last line of
    output, (caused a blank line). The display also uses the default background
    color, and senses when the theme/color/fonts change.
  > Now clicking a line from the tail module opens a window containing the
    tailed file.
  - Size hint buttons (porperties) are only enabled when using a panel
    that supports size hints, implemented 'use all room on panel' option

Installation:
  basically make ; make install should do it.

  The applet can then be run by selecting:
   'Panel'->'Add applet'->'Utility'->'Tick-a-Stat'

Note:
  - No autoconf scripts, so there.

Eventually, complete module specs will be in the MODULE-SPEC file.
