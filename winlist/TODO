I started to work on this but I'm getting dragged into some other
problems, so I wanted to get this out so others could work on it...

The idea is as follows:

run the panel first
run fvwm
have fvwm load the winlist_applet

The winlist_applet will use a pipe from fvwm to listen to messages
fvwm creates when it does window ops. The idea is to have buttons
on the panel which correspond to top level windows (ala win95 taskbar).

If you build the testwinlist.c and run it as a module from fvwm,
it will list these messages. I couldn't get the winlist_applet to
work - it seems I would setup the gdk_input_add() and never would
get anything back from fvwm.

Email me if you want to work on this and need more info. This would
be VERY USEFUL for the panel.
