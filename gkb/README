This is the gkb, a GNOME pager applet to change your keymap with a mouse-click.
It's just a pre-code, so feel free to bomb me any suggestions, ideas.

Lot of thanx for Pablo Saratxaga <srtxg@chanae.alphanet.ch> for many beauty
pixmaps.

Thanks for Balazs Nagy <julian7@kva.hu> for his minor help, but the applet
is mine.
