This is the gkb, a GNOME pager applet to change your keymap with a mouse-click.

To install please check out you have at least GNOME 0.25 on your system, and
set the path in the installscript to be sure the applet will working good.

This is just a pre-code, so feel free to bomb me any suggestions, ideas.

 TODO:
  option setting at properties dialog
  pixmap caching, <- it's a hard technical question, help if u can
  error handling, <- hmmm... that is needed?
  lots of bugfixes... (if I find a)

If you don't want to recompile with the gnome-core, run the installscript
after checking paths in that script.

Lot of thanx for Pablo Saratxaga <srtxg@chanae.alphanet.ch> for many beauty
pixmaps.
