This is the gkb, a GNOME pager applet to change your keymap with a mouse-click.

To install please check out you have at least GNOME 0.25 on your system, and
set the path in the installscript to be sure the applet will working good.

This is just a pre-code, so feel free to bomb me any suggestions, ideas.
(I've got more, but that is young, I made it last night)

 TODO:
  more icons and keyboard maps,
  pixmap refleshing
  lots of bugfixes... (if I find a)

 If I find the way, how can I reflesh the pixmaps, and preload them for
 the quick change of them, I will make the 0.99 (pre 1.0?).
