This version of odometer supports pixmaps digits. Adding new pixmaps is
really easy. Please feel free to contribute. New pixmaps can easily be
adapted from web counters digits for example.

Pixmaps are stored in $(pixmapsdir)/odometer. Each pixmap must contain
the suite of digits "0123456789.". You just have to respect this order,
and not to forget the dot. Each item has the same size, so the resulting
pixmap width is multiple of eleven.
