   <title>The Odometer Applet</title>
   <para>
     The GNOME panel <application>odometer</application> is an applet
     which tracks and measures the movements of your mouse pointer across
     the desktop. It is part of the gnome-applets package. This section
     of the guide refers to odometer-0.5, which is distributed in
     gnome-applets-1.1.2.
   </para>
   <para>
     To add the odometer to your <interface>panel</interface>, you can
     start it by <mousebutton>right</mousebutton>-clicking on
     an empty part of the <interface>panel</interface> and following the 
     sequence
    <menuchoice>
     <guimenu>Applets</guimenu>
     <guisubmenu>Amusements</guisubmenu>
     <guimenuitem>Odometer</guimenuitem>
    </menuchoice>
     or you can issue this command at a command prompt: 
     <command>odometer_applet --activate-goad-server=odometer_applet &amp </command>

       Once it is present, you don't need to do anything to the odometer.
       If you want to, though, the following options are available:

         Holding down the <mousebutton>middle</mousebutton> button allows you
         to move the odometer about in the same way you move anything on the
         panel.

       <para>
         Pressing the <mousebutton>right</mousebutton> button brings
         up the standard choices available for applets, including a
         <guilabel>properties menu</guilabel> explained <link
         linkend="odometerapplet-prefs">below</link>, and an 
         About box.
       </para>
      </listitem>
     </orderedlist>
     <para>
       In addition, moving the mouse pointer over the odometer produces
       a <guilabel>tooltip</guilabel> telling you the distance you have
       travelled.

       The <interface>properties dialogue box</interface> (which calls
       itself &quot;Odometer setting&quot; rather than properties) is divided into
       two sections, one for general options, and one for themes.

          <listitem>
           <para>
             If the <guibutton>use metric checkbox</guibutton> is checked,
             mouse pointer distance travelled is shown in metres. If it
             is not checked, the distance travelled is shown in feet. By
             moving the pointer over the odometer you can produce a 
             <guilabel>tooltip</guilabel> which shows you whether it is
             currently displaying metres or feet.

             If the <guibutton>enabled checkbox</guibutton> is checked, then
             the odometer will keep counting how far you have moved your
             pointer. If not, it will return the numbers to zero until you
             re-enable it.

             The <guibutton>digits number field</guibutton> determines how

             the range is from 1 to 10.
