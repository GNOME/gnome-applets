2000-02-23  Peter Hawkins <peterhawkins@ozemail.com.au>

	* odo.c: stopped about box from being shown multiple times at once.

2000-02-12  Jacob Berkman  <jacob@helixcode.com>

	* odo.c (refresh): 
	* theme.c (load_theme): patch from PeterHawkins
	<peterhawkins@ozemail.com.au>

2000-02-01  Jacob Berkman  <jacob@helixcode.com>

	* theme.c (change_theme): don't hard-code a prefix
	of /usr/local.  Things are still not robust but are
	highly likely to work.

2000-01-30  Fabrice Bellet <Fabrice.Bellet@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>

	* odo.c : Added Tom's anti-warning trick in the 
	new functions.

2000-01-30  Fabrice Bellet <Fabrice.Bellet@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>

	* odo.[hc], properties.c, theme.c : added a checkbutton in
	the properties box to let the user choose to adapt or not
	the applet to the panel size.

2000-01-30  Fabrice Bellet <Fabrice.Bellet@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>

	* properties.c: fixed the case of the default theme, that
	doesn't have to appear twice in the theme's list.
	* README.themes: updated doc.
	* theme.c (removed load_default_theme, change_theme modified),
	def_theme/Default-black.xpm removed,
	def_theme/Default-red.xpm removed,
	def_theme/themedata removed,
	def_theme/Makefile.am removed,
	Makefile.am,
	themes/default/default-black.png added,
	themes/default/default-red.png added,
	themes/default/themedata added: removed the default_theme pixmap.
	This default theme is now banalized with others themes.
	* odo.c (draw_digit, draw_value),
	odo.h (removed get_pixmap, added get_image, load_theme),
	theme.c: changed the theme management from pixmaps to
	GdkImlibImage structs. The advantage is that GdkImlibImage
	automagically handle rendering at different sizes.
	* odo.c (size_render, odo_change_orient, odo_change_pixel_size):
	Added handlers for panel pixel size changes and panel orientation
	changes.
	* themes/*/themedata: removed digit_width, which can be computed
	from the RGB image width.

	* On an anti-warning hunt using CFLAGS="-O6 -g -W -Wall
	-Wmissing-prototypes -Wmissing-declarations". Don't mind me.

1999-10-18  Jacob Berkman  <jberkman@andrew.cmu.edu>

	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): dist the pixmap

1999-10-13  Fabrice Bellet <Fabrice.Bellet@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>

	* gnome-odometer.png: Added and commited.
	* Makefile.am: Install gnome-odometer.png.

1999-10-12  Jacob Berkman  <jberkman@andrew.cmu.edu>

	* Makefile.am: reverting previous commit until 
	the .png shows up

1999-10-12  Fabrice Bellet <Fabrice.Bellet@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>

	* gnome-odometer.png: Added.
	* Makefile.am: Install gnome-odometer.png.
	* odometer_applet.desktop: Use gnome-odometer.png.
	* corrected typo in directory name in themes/Makefile.am.

1999-09-04  Fabrice Bellet <Fabrice.Bellet@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>

	* README.themes : Updated the themes structure explanation.
	* Updated my email address.

1999-08-31  Fabrice Bellet <Fabrice.Bellet@imag.fr>

	* def-theme/{Makefile.am, themedata, Default-black.xpm,
	Default-red.xpm} : Changed the theme structure. One pixmap is used
	for black digits, representing the integer part of the displayed
	value, and one pixmap for red digits, representing the decimal
	part of the value. Added a themedata file to customize the aspect
	(with or without the decimal dot). Idea suggested by Armen
	Nakashian.
	* themes, themes/Makefile.am : Added this directory to separate the
	code from the themes.
	* themes/{57chevy, A, bbldotg, o, smplst}/ : Added these theme
	directories.
	* odo.h: Added a second pixmap in the OdoApplet struct. Bumped
	version number.
	* odo.c (load_default_theme, change_theme) : moved these procedures
	to a separate file.
	* odo.c (draw_digit, draw_value) : changed these functions in order
	to select the right pixmap according to the current position of the
	digit compared to the digital dot.
	* odo.c (init_applet) : new pixmap reset.
	* properties.c (populate_theme_list) : changed the theme selection
	scheme, previously based on file listing, and based now on directory
	listing.
	* theme.c : Added procedures still inspired from theme management
	part of sound-monitor by John Ellis. They mainly implement the
	themedata file parsing, and the theme/pixmap loading.

1999-07-26  Fabrice Bellet <Fabrice.Bellet@imag.fr>

	* odo.c, odo.h: Cleaned up the code, removed global variables.
	* properties.c: Added support for a theme chooser, based on
	pixmap substitution into the digit drawing scheme. Added the
	choice of the number of significants digits.
	* 57chevy.xpm, A.xpm, B.xpm, bbldotg.xpm, fp2.xpm, mpurple.xpm,
	o.xpm, smplst.xpm: Added digits pixmaps adapted from web counter
	digits.

1999-07-23  Fabrice Bellet <Fabrice.Bellet@imag.fr>

	* odo.c: Removed the use of gtk-1.3 string functions.

1999-07-19  Fabrice Bellet <Fabrice.Bellet@imag.fr>

	* odo.c: Solved the refresh problem, and the automatic restart bug.
