	* def-theme/{Makefile.am, themedata, Default-black.xpm,
	Default-red.xpm} : Changed the theme structure. One pixmap is used
	for black digits, representing the integer part of the displayed
	value, and one pixmap for red digits, representing the decimal
	part of the value. Added a themedata file to customize the aspect
	(with or without the decimal dot). Idea suggested by Armen
	Nakashian.
	* themes, themes/Makefile.am : Added this directory to separate the
	code from the themes.
	* themes/{57chevy, A, bbldotg, o, smplst}/ : Added these theme
	directories.
	* odo.h: Added a second pixmap in the OdoApplet struct. Bumped
	version number.
	* odo.c (load_default_theme, change_theme) : moved these procedures
	to a separate file.
	* odo.c (draw_digit, draw_value) : changed these functions in order
	to select the right pixmap according to the current position of the
	digit compared to the digital dot.
	* odo.c (init_applet) : new pixmap reset.
	* properties.c (populate_theme_list) : changed the theme selection
	scheme, previously based on file listing, and based now on directory
	listing.
	* theme.c : Added procedures still inspired from theme management
	part of sound-monitor by John Ellis. They mainly implement the
	themedata file parsing, and the theme/pixmap loading.

	* odo.c, odo.h: Cleaned up the code, removed global variables.
	* properties.c: Added support for a theme chooser, based on
	pixmap substitution into the digit drawing scheme. Added the
	choice of the number of significants digits.
	* 57chevy.xpm, A.xpm, B.xpm, bbldotg.xpm, fp2.xpm, mpurple.xpm,
	o.xpm, smplst.xpm: Added digits pixmaps adapted from web counter
	digits.
