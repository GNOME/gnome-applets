Sound Monitor is a GNOME panel applet, it displays the current Volume
output of the Esound daemon, also, optionally shows the Esound
status: Off(error), Standby, Ready. The esound daemon can also be
started, set to standby, and resumed from the applet's right click menu.
The esound server's information can also be displayed(streams, sample info).
Panning (left - right) can also be adjusted for streams and samples.

A few sample skins are included / installed with the applet.

Requirements:
  - GNOME version 1.0.1 or higher. (http://www.gnome.org)
  - Esound version 0.2.8 or higher. (http://www.tux.org/~ricdude/news.html)

Notes for this release:
  0.7.0 contains these changes from 0.6.1:
  - The scope now displays points as segments (by default).
  - Added configurable esd host to monitor (untested).
  - Added option to monitor sound card input.
      NOTE: This wants to hang my system when esound attempts to play a sound
            while monitoring input. To enable this, uncomment the ADVANCED_OPTS
            line in the Makefile, and the option will show up in the advanced
            properties tab.
  * Fix so scope always goes flat with no sound.

  NOTE: esdpvd is unusable at this point as a memory leak in esound causes it to
        gobble up memory, I will attempt to get the fix included with esound.

Installation:
  basically make ; make install should do it.

  The applet can then be run by selecting:
   'Panel'->'Add applet'->'Multimedia'->'Sound Monitor'

Note:
  - No autoconf scripts, so there.

Additional themes go into (gnome-prefix)/share/sound-monitor
To make your own theme, see the THEME-SPEC file.
