  <title>Sound Monitor Applet</title>

  <para>
   <application>Sound Monitor</application> applet, shown in its
   default theme(appearance) in <xref
   linkend="soundmonitorapplet-fig">, is a sound volume display and an
   interface for controlling ESD (the Enlightened Sound Daemon). If
   you are not familiar with ESD, it is a program which controls sound
   on your system and allows all of your applications to play sound at
   the same time.  To add this applet to a <interface>Panel</interface>, 
   right-click on the <interface>Panel</interface> and choose
   <menuchoice>
    <guimenu>Panel</guimenu>

  <!-- ============= Usage  ================================ -->
  <sect2 id="soundmonitorapplet-usage">
   <title>Usage</title>
   <para>
    <application>Sound Monitor</application> always displays the
    volume of sound being produced on your system graphically.
    You may control sound by turning ESD on or off by right-clicking
    on the applet and selecting <guimenuitem>Place Esound in
    standby</guimenuitem> or <guimenuitem>Resume Esound</guimenuitem>
    respectively, as described below.  
   </para>

   <para>
    Right-clicking on the applet brings up a menu containing the
    following items:
    <itemizedlist>

     <listitem>
      <para>
       <guimenuitem>Manager&hellip;</guimenuitem> &mdash; brings
       up the <link linkend="soundmonitorapplet-manager">
       <interface>Sound Monitor Manager</interface></link> dialog,
       which allows you to view and control current ESD settings.
      </para>
     </listitem>

     <listitem>
      <para>
       <guimenuitem>Place Esound in
       standby</guimenuitem>/<guimenuitem>Resume
       Esound</guimenuitem>/<guimenuitem>Start
       Esound</guimenuitem> &mdash; At any time, you will only
       have one of these three items, depending on whether ESD is
       running and what its status is. The first two menu items
       allow you to
       temporarily place ESD in standby and then resume ESD.
       This is useful if you have a sound application which is
       unable to work with ESD, but needs direct access to the
       sound device. The third allows you to start
       <application>Esound</application> if it is not started.

    <title>Note About Sound in GNOME</title>
    <para>
     For sound to work in GNOME, you must have sound enabled in the
     <application>Control Center</application>.  To configure sound,
     click on the <guibutton>Main Menu</guibutton> button (the foot
     icon) and select
     <menuchoice>
      <guimenu>Programs</guimenu>
      <guisubmenu>Setting</guisubmenu>
      <guisubmenu>Multimedia</guisubmenu>
      <guimenuitem>Sound</guimenuitem>
     </menuchoice>. Make sure both sound options are enabled in the
     <guilabel>General</guilabel> tab.  Feel free to configure and
     test things in the <guilabel>Sound Events</guilabel> section.
     Note that you may have to exit GNOME and restart for sound to
     work properly after enabling it in the <application>Control
     Center</application> for the first time.

        anything until you have modified the theme, as described

  <!-- ============= ESDPVD ================================== -->
  <sect2 id="esdpvd">
   <title>The Esound Persistent Volume Daemon (ESDPVD)</title>
   <para>
    The <application>Sound Monitor</application> applet comes with a
    companion program called the <application>Esound Persistent Volume
    Daemon</application>
    (ESDPVD), which can run in the background and remembers the volume
    and balance of each stream that connects to the sound server. The
    main purpose of <application>ESDPVD</application> is to be used in
    conjunction with the <application>Sound Monitor</application>
    applet's <interface>Manager</interface> dialog 
    to retain volume levels for individual streams that
    connect to the ESD sound server.
   </para>
   <para>
    As an example, suppose you are running the
    <application>GTCD</application> CD Player and you 
    lower its volume using the <interface>Manager</interface> window. Normally
    the volume setting will be lost when the program(in this case
    <application>GTCD</application>) is exited and
    restarted. However, if <application>esdpvd</application> is
    running and you start <application>GTCD</application> again, the
    volume will be restored to its previous (in this case, 
    lower) value from before. 
   </para>
   <para>
    If you configure GNOME to start <application>ESDPVD</application>
    each time GNOME is started (using the
    <interface>control-center</interface>'s <interface>Startup 
    Programs</interface> section), <application>ESDPVD</application> will remember
    sound volume and balance customizations between GNOME sessions.
   </para>
   <para>
    <application>ESDPVD</application> also remembers volume and
    balance adjustments to cached samples (often used for interface
    sound events such as button clicks, menus, etc.).
