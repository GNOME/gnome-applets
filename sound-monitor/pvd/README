esdpvd is a small program that remembers the volume and balance of streams and
samples active within esound. It then restores the values when a subsequent
stream with the same id (name) connects to esound. This allows the volume and
balance preferences to be kept between sound playback events and sessions.

Requirements:
  - GNOME version 1.0.1 or higher. (http://www.gnome.org)
    (uses gnome-config. however, an X server is not needed since there is no gui)
  - Esound version 0.2.8 or higher. (http://www.tux.org/~ricdude/news.html)

Notes for this release:
  - Initial release.

  Functions to subscribe for change events is not implemented in esound at the
  time of this releaase. So this app uses a method that involves more overhead
  than the subscribe method.

  Due to the same reason as above, settings are not instantly restored, you can
  usually hear the sounds play at normal (default) volume and balance for a
  moment during the start of a sound (unavoidable).

Installation:
  basically make ; make install should do it.

  The executable is named esdpvd

Settings:
  Currently no run time options are implemented.
  States of streams and samples are stored in ~/.gnome/esd_persistent_volumes
