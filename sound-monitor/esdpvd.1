.SH NAME
esdpvd \- ESounD Persistent Volume Daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBesdpvd\fR [ \fBNo option\fR] 

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBesdpvd\fR is a small program that remembers
the volume and balance of streams and samples active within esound. It
then restores the values when a subsequent stream with the same id
(name) connects to esound. This allows the volume and balance
preferences to be kept between sound playback events and
sessions.
.PP
The main purpose of \fBesdpvd\fR is to be used
in conjunction with the Sound Monitor applet's Manager dialog to
retain volume levels for individual streams that connect to the ESD
sound server.
