Sat Jul 28 01:31:43 2001  Abel Cheung  <maddog@linux.org.hk>

	* pvd/esdpvd.c: changed description for -n(--noX) option, it should
	mean "without X" instead of "with X"

	will be restarted between sessions without special handling.
	Retained the old behavior of not requiring X by adding the -n, --noX
	command line option. Also made the reported version be VERSION.

Mon Oct 23 16:39:10 2000  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

Fri Sep 29 18:04:47 2000  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* Syncing current version into CVS, an edited copy of the ChangeLog
	is below.
	Note: fft.c needs lots of work, left it in in case someone wants to
	fix it for a proper spectrum analyzer. A test theme is included,
	spectra-clear, to test the spectrum analyzer from analyzer.[ch] and
	fft.[ch]. spectra-clear is not installed at this time.

	I will make sure this all passes make distcheck once I sync clockmail
	applet onto CVS too.

	--

	* analyzer.[ch]: Added an spectrum analyzer display widget.
	* fft.[ch]: FFT routines.
	* skin.c, theme.c, update.c: Added analyzer to theme spec.

	* main.c: use pixel size stuff

Mon Oct 25 19:39:14 1999  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* theme.c (change_to_skin): Use SIZEHINT_STANDARD in place of
	SIZE_STANDARD. (for gnome-core 1.0.x compat., and its a bug)

Fri Oct 22 17:36:58 1999  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* main.c: Added #ifdef's around panel size code, it should
	now compile with 1.0.x of gnome-core.

Fri Aug 20 18:34:17 1999  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* main.c: use gtk_widget_set_rc_style to avoid warnings

Fri Aug 20 08:20:24 1999  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* main.c, theme.c: Don't use gdk_imlib_free_bitmap !

	scope_tiny_h.png, scope_tiny_v.png, themedata}: Likewise.
	* themes/scope-larger/{Makefile.am, back_tiny_h.png, back_tiny_v.png,
	scope_tiny_h.png, scope_tiny_v.png, themedata}: Likewise.
	* themes.scope-round/{Makefile.am, back_tiny.png, scope_tiny.png,
	themedata}: Likewise.

Tue Jul 13 17:06:44 1999  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* main.c, theme.c, sound-monitor.h: Make it follow panel size hints,
	and extended theme spec to include various sizes. Now use VERSION from
	config.h (this means a version 1.0 will never exist).

Wed Jul  7 17:54:18 1999  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* main.c (update_display): Update vu items if data comes in even while
	in autostandby.

	* sound-monitor.h, README: Release 0.7.0

Tue Jun  8 17:09:28 1999  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* Makefile, sound-monitor.h, main.c, esdcalls.c, properties.c: Added
	advance properties to configure the host to monitor. Also added option
	to monitor sound card input, but this requires uncommenting a line
	in the Makefile because it wants to hang the system when esd attempts
	to play a sound while monitoring.
	(My SB awe64 _is_ full duplex, must be a driver or esound bug?)

Tue Jun  8 15:35:09 1999  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* main.c, sound-monitor.h, theme.c, properties.c: Add option to draw 
	scope with connected points. Enabled by default.
	* main.c: Fix bug that caused scope to occasionally not go flat when
	sound stops.

Wed May 26 20:42:24 1999  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* sound-monitor.h, README: Release 0.6.1

Wed May 26 20:41:20 1999  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* sound-monitor.spec: Added an rpm spec file, not tested. 

Wed May 26 20:26:17 1999  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* manager.c: Added volume control to the manager window for streams
	and samples.
	* dvp/*: Added the esdpvd program, which remembers the volume of each
	sample and stream between playbacks and sessions. With the use of
	esdpvd the manager window now has more useful purpose.
	
Thu Apr  1 10:39:53 1999  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* README, sound-monitor.h: Release 0.6.0

Thu Apr  1 10:28:58 1999  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* manager.c: Add ability to adjust panning of streams and samples, and
	added count of streams/samples to server info.
	* esdcalls.c: Fix left/right reversal?

Thu Apr  1 07:39:44 1999  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* theme.c (draw_scope_item): Clear the clip mask after drawing, since
	the mask was interfering with other drawing calls. Having multiple
	sound-monitor type widgets on the panel works now.

Thu Feb 25 12:45:17 1999  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* sound-monitor.h: Release version 0.5.0

Thu Feb 25 02:26:42 1999  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	scope, scope-larger(includes a vertical version), and scope-round.
	* Makefile: added (un)install of above themes.

Thu Feb 25 01:20:38 1999  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* theme.c: Scopes can now be vertical (data streams from top down).

Thu Feb 25 00:20:10 1999  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* theme.c: Added a scope widget (guess what it does ;)
	* main.c, sound-monitor.h: Use above scope widget.
	* properties.c: Add scope scale factor, up maximum frame rate to
	40 fps, so the scope can show more data (I like the scope at 40).

Wed Feb 24 18:13:05 1999  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* manager.c: Fixes to the update-window checks, clicking on the Length
	column title of sample list toggles the display to minutes:seconds.

Sat Feb 20 19:28:19 1999  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* sound-monitor.h: Release version 0.4.0

Sat Feb 20 19:18:48 1999  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* manager.c: New file, contains the code for the 'manage window'.
	The manage window displays  various information of the esd daemon
	and allows cached samples to be played by clicking on them.
	* main.c, sound-monitor.h: Changes necessary to open the above manager
	from the pop-up menu, and to close the window on applet destruction.
	* Makefile.am: Small updates.

Wed Feb 17 06:33:54 1999  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* sound-monitor.h: Release version 0.3.0

Wed Feb 17 06:08:28 1999  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* main.c: The connection to esound is now closed when the status
	returns an error. The user is now notifyed by an error message
	indicating esd has exited, or (gasp) crashed.

Tue Feb 16 18:17:47 1999  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* main.c:  added #include "config.h"
	* sound-monitor.h: removed <config.h> from here, as it only makes
	sense here when used with autoconf/make and we do not.

Tue Feb 16 14:05:10 1999  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* def_theme/status*.xpm: Updated for the new autostandby indicator.
	* themes/*/*status*.png: Likewise.
	* THEME-SPEC: Likewise.

Tue Feb 16 13:32:17 1999  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* esdcalls.c (esd_check_status): New function to return the status
	of  teh esound daemon, uses the new esd_get_standby_mode() call.
	Sound Monitor now requires a version of esound dated at least around
	this entry's date stamp.
	* theme.c: Added all status_item loads to use 4 display modes, the new
	mode is to indicate autostandby.
	* main.c: Use the new esd_check_status() function to optain esd's
	status, when no sound data is received, reset the sound level meter to
	zero (new function fro this: do_zero_volume_check() ). The esd control
	menu item now works with autostandby status too.
	* sound-monitor.h: Updates needed for the above changes.

Mon Feb  8 13:28:12 1999  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* sound-monitor.h, main.c: New files renamed from vumeter.h and
	vumeter.c, respectivley.
	* main.c, esdcalls.c : Added cleanup routines to shut down the 
	connection to esound when an applet exits. Added Esound status control
	on the right click menu.
	* theme.c, def_theme/*.xpm : Changed the default theme, and moved the
	default theme's image files top def_theme/*
	* all files: Changes to the applets name, internal name id strings,
	version bumped to 0.2.0
