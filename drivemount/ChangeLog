Sun May 28 14:47:05 2000  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* drivemount.c (device_is_in_mountlist): When checking for a string
	within a string, make sure there is no additional text. (Ex: The test
	for /mnt/cdrom was also seeing /mnt/cdrom2 because the first 10 chars
	match.) Fixes BUG #12094

Mon May 08 19:16:45 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	NULL instead of a 0 in strstr() check. Update copyright year to 2000 in
	about window.
	* properties.c: strdup -> g_strdup.

2000-03-15  Jason Leach  <leach@wam.umd.edu>

Thu Mar  2 19:54:01 2000  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* drivemount.c (get_device): returns gint instead of dev_t. return -1
	on error.
	* (device_is_mounted): return false if any get_device calls return
	error (-1). Now incorrect mount points do not show a mounted status.
	(fixes BUG #6770).
	* drivemount.[ch]: Used the applet_widget_set_tooltip function, instead
	of setting one manually, in attempt to fix BUG #6769, although I can't
	duplicate it, and am not even sure if the applet or panel is to blame.

Tue Feb 29 05:26:04 2000  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	times.

2000-02-11  Jason Leach  <leach@wam.umd.edu>

	* drivemount.c (device_is_in_mountlist): fixing bug reported in
	#2275, you can't do buf[201] = '\0' because with a declared char
	buf[201], the last element is actually buf[200]

Sat Feb 05 17:37:34 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* drivemount.c: fix possible segfault and test for the output of
	"eject -u" since some eject progs don't take the -u option and
	will umount by themselves

Sat Jan 29 00:57:32 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@tomgilbert.freeserve.co.uk>

	* On an anti-warning hunt using CFLAGS="-O6 -g -W -Wall
