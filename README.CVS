This is the module of GNOME where most panel applets are kept.  The basic
applets that are always used are in the gnome-panel module, however.

This is the development branch. Stable branches has names like gnome-2-8,
gnome-2-10 and gnome-2-12. The current stable branch (as of October '05) is
gnome-2-12 which stems from the branch point GNOME_APPLETS_2_12_BRANCHPOINT.
