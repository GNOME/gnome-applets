This is the module of GNOME where most panel applets are kept.  The basic
applets that are always used are in the gnome-panel module, however.

This is the development branch. Stable branches has names like gnome-2-10,
gnome-2-12 and gnome-2-14. The current stable branch (as of April '06) is
gnome-2-14 which stems from the branch point GNOME_APPLETS_2_14_BRANCHPOINT.
